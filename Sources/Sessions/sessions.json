    "description" : "Learn how the Advanced Video Quality Tool (AVQT) can help you accurately assess the perceptual quality of your compressed video files. Utilizing the AVFoundation framework, AVQT supports a wide range of video formats, codecs, resolutions and frame-rates in both the SDR and HDR domains, which results in easy and efficient workflows — for example, no requirement to decode to a raw pixel format.\n\nAVQT uses Metal to achieve high processing speeds by offloading heavy pixel-level computation to the GPU, typically analyzing videos in excess of real-time video frame rates. With incredible ease of use and computational efficiency, AVQT can help you eliminate low-quality videos from your video catalog before they might otherwise reach people in your app.",
