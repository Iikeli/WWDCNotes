The journey continues as we explore how our sample gardening app can adapt to a person’s preferences and specific workflows. Learn how SwiftUI apps can automatically react to system settings, and discover how you can use that information to add more personality to an app. We’ll show you how you can give people the flexibility to customize an app through Settings, and explore how to use different workflows for manipulating someone’s data (like drag and drop). To finish, we’ll show you how you can move data to and from an app, incorporating features like Continuity Camera to provide a simple workflow for importing images.\n\nThis is the second session in a two-part Code-Along series.

We’ll take a look at APIs that can cause unexpected states if not used correctly, and how you can write code more specifically to avoid undefined behavior. Learn how to work with C APIs that use pointers and the steps to take when you want to use Swift’s unsafe pointer APIs.\n\nTo get the most out of this session, you should have some familiarity with Swift and the C programming language. And for more information on working with pointers, check out \"Safely Manage Pointers in Swift\".",

We’ll walk you through the tools available in the Metal System Trace instrument and Metal Debugger in Xcode 12 to profile your graphics workload, and show you how to use collected data to discover underused and overworked stages of your GPU pipeline. Discover how you can act on that data to improve your app's capabilities.\n\nTo get the most out of the session, you should understand the tile-based deferred rendering architecture of Apple GPUs and familiarize yourself with our recommended best practices for performance optimization. For a primer, check out “Delivering optimized Metal apps and games” and “Harness Apple GPUs with Metal.”\n\nOnce you’ve learned how to act on GPU counter data to optimize your Metal apps, see how you can use those skills to \"Bring your Metal app to Apple silicon Macs\" and \"Optimize Metal Performance for Apple silicon Macs\"."

Learn how you can translate or port your graphics-intensive app over to Apple silicon, and how to take advantage of TBDR and Metal when building natively for the platform. We’ll look at how TBDR compares with the Immediate Mode Rendering pipeline of older Macs, go through common issues you may face when bringing an app or game over, and explore how to offer incredible performance when building with the native SDK.\n\nWe’ve designed this session in tandem with “Optimize Metal Performance for Apple silicon Macs.” After you’ve watched this session be sure to check that out next.",
