    "description" : "When Ajit Narayanan began working on technologies for children with disabilities in India in 2008, it was the beginning of an incredible journey down a rabbit hole — one that took him and his team on a wild ride across the worlds of electrical engineering, autism, cross-cultural communication and the mathematics of language. His journey led him to build Avaz, a wheelchair-mounted tablet to help people with disabilities communicate, then even more ambitiously, to invent FreeSpeech, an entirely new visual language that could break down language barriers altogether. Ajit will talk about the series of events that led to the creation of the Avaz and FreeSpeech apps, their impact in India and around the world (earning him the National Award for Empowerment of People with Disabilities from the President of India) and his ideas on the transformative role that apps can play in education.",

After graduating from Stanford with a degree in Mechanical Engineering and Product Design, she had firsthand knowledge of how significantly men outnumber women in science, technology, engineering and math.  Debbie then became obsessed with the notion of \"disrupting the pink aisle\" with a toy that would introduce girls to the joy of engineering at a young age.  Industry leaders told her the idea would fail, but less than three years after launching GoldieBlox on Kickstarter, she has made significant strides in her quest to bridge the gender gap in STEM:  she has launched massively successful viral videos, a Superbowl ad that brought mainstream awareness to her mission, an award-winning iOS app and GoldieBlox presence in more than 6,000 retail stores worldwide.  Debbie has also recently been selected to join the Presidential Ambassadors for Global Entrepreneurship, a select group 'committed to helping develop the next generation of entrepreneurs around the world.'  Hear Debbie's story of challenging the status quo, achieving audacious goals, and igniting a national conversation about breaking gender stereotypes."
