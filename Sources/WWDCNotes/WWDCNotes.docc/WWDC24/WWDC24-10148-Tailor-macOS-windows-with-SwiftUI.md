# Tailor macOS windows with SwiftUI

Make your windows feel tailor-made for macOS. Fine-tune your appâ€™s windows for focused purposes, ease of use, and to express functionality. Use SwiftUI to style window toolbars and backgrounds. Arrange your windows with precision, and make smart decisions about restoration and minimization.

# Anatomy of a window
- Windows are a fundamental unit for drawing UI on the Mac.
- A typical window has a few recognizable components.
- From front to back: toolbar, content, background, and shadow.

@Image(source: "anatomy-of-a-window", alt: "The anatomy of a window.")

- These components can be customized using SwiftUI.
- To learn more about windows and scenes in SwiftUI, watch [Bring multiple windows to your SwiftUI app](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc22/10061) and [Work with windows in SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc24/10149).

# Style toolbars
- The title in the toolbar can be removed using the new `.toolbar(removing:)` modifier.
- Customize the background of a toolbar using `.toolbarBackgroundVisibility(_:for:)`.
- Both modifiers are applied to the root view of the scene.

# Refine behaviors

## Apply material to windows
- You can now apply a material directly to the root view of a window.
- Use the `.containerBackground(_:,for:)` on the root view of the scene.

```swift
Window("Title", id: "about") {
    AboutView()
        .containerBackground(.thickMaterial, for: .window)
}
```

## Disable window controls
- Customize the visibility of the Minimize traffic light button using `.windowMinimizeBehavior(_:)`.
    - The modifier applies to the root view.
- Change state restoration behavior using `.restorationBehavior(_:)`.
    - SwiftUI enables state restoration for windows by default.
    - Windows like the About window should not restore state.
    - This is a scene modifier, so it applies to the window scene instead of its root view.

# Adjust window placement
- Customize where your windows appear on the screen.

## Initial placement
- Control where on the screen the window appears initially.
- Use the `.defaultWindowPlacement(_:)` modifier, which accepts a closure.
    - 2 arguments will be supplied to you:
    - `content`: A proxy view for querying the size of the content.
    - `context`: The information about the display.
- Compute the size and position inside the closure.
- Return a `WindowPlacement` instance from the closure.
- The modifier applies to the scene.

## Ideal placement
- Account for ways the window can be resized while it is open.
- Use the `.windowIdealPlacement(_:)` modifier.
- The closure is similar to one used for `.defaultWindowPlacement(_:)`.

# More to explore
- Borderless windows using `.windowStyle(_:)`.
- Default launch behavior using `.defaultLaunchBehavior(_:)`.
