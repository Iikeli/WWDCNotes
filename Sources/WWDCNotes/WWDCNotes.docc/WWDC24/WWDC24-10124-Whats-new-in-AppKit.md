# New macOS Features

## Writing Tools
- Apps get the features automatically, but can customize behavior using new APIs
- Watch [Get started with Writing Tools](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc24/10168)

## Genmoji
- Genmoji are images, so some adoption may be needed
- Watch [Bring expression to your app with Genmoji](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc24/10220)

## Image Playground
- Instantiate `ImagePlaygroundViewController` and assign its delegate
- Can customize the behavior by specifying initial `concepts` and `sourceImage`
- Users can still choose different images and concepts as part of the experience
- Get the generated image from the app's sandboxed temporary directory
- Consider adding Image Playground as an image source

## Window Tiling
- Makes it *very* fast to move windows into some common arrangements
- Holding `Option` while dragging shows a preview of the window immediately
- Available in the Window > Move & Resize menu, and accessible using keyboard shortcuts
- Can resize windows at the same time while they are side by side
- Can select pre-built window arrangements from the Window menu

### Making apps work best with Window Tiling
- Consider your window's minimum and maximum sizes
- Use the `resizeIncrements` property
- When opening windows, consider the new `cascadingReferenceFrame`
    - This gets you an existing window's *untiled* frame
    - Cascade newly-opened windows relative to that frame

# More SwiftUI integrations

## Build menus with SwiftUI
- New `NSMenu` subclass: `NSHostingMenu`
- Create the menu definition using SwiftUI, then instantiate `NSHostingMenu` using the SwiftUI view
- Use in any AppKit context accepting `NSMenu`

## SwiftUI animations
- You can now use SwiftUI animations to animate AppKit views
- Use `NSAnimationContext`, passing in the SwiftUI animation type
- Interruptible by default
- For more info, watch [Enhance your UI animations and transitions](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc24/10145)

# API refinements

## Context menus
- Use keyboard to open any context menus
- `Control-Return` by default
- Customize where the menu appears by implementing `NSViewContentSelectionInfo` protocol

## Text and SF Symbols

### Text highlighting
- Text highlighting is supported by default by `NSTextView` subclasses that support rich text
- Controlled by attributed string attributes (`.textHighlight` and `.textHighlightColorScheme`)

### SF Symbols 6
- New effects: `wiggle`, `rotate`, `breathe`
- Repeating animations
- Dynamically replace the symbols badge and slash
- Check out What's new in SF Symbols 6 and Animate symbols in your app

## Saving documents
- Standard file format picker for `NSSavePanel`
- Set `showsContentTypes` property on `NSSavePanel` to true
- To provide custom display names for formats, implement a new delegate method

## Customizable toolbars

### Cursors
- System cursors are now available in SDK
- Access resize cursors using `frameResize(position:directions:)`
- Use `zoomIn` and `zoomOut` to indicate magnification
- Prefer using standard system cursors
- System cursors automatically support accessibility sizes and colors

### NSToolbar
- Use `allowsDisplayModeCustomization` to let the user customize display modes of your toolbars, even if they are not customizable
    - Make sure that your toolbar has an identifier
    - Check that all your toolbar items have good labels
- Conditionally show and hide items using the new `isHidden` property
    - Useful for situationally meaningful changes
    - Hidden items still appear in the customization panel

### Text entry suggestions
- Works on any `NSTextField`
- Get started by setting `suggestionsDelegate` property on `NSTextField`
- Can provide results synchronously or asynchronously
- Design tips
    - Ensure suggestions are responsive
    - Preserve muscle memory by making results predictable
    - Keep it simple

# Next steps
- Adopt new macOS features, like Intelligence and Window Tiling
- Improve SwiftUI integration by using menus and animations
- Explore new APIs and consider adopting
