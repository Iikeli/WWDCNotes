## UIView animation APIs Overview

### Basic API

Before iOS 4 we had the following APIs:

```objc
+ (void) beginAnimations:context:
+ (void) commitAnimations
```

iOS 4 introduced block-based APIs:

```objc
+ (void)animateWithDuration:(NSTimeInterval)duration
                      delay:(NSTimeInterval)delay
                    options:(UIViewAnimationOptions)options
                 animations:(void (^)(void))animations
                 completion:(void (^)(BOOL finished))completion;
```

Relationship to core animation:

- [`animateWithDuration:animations:completion:`][animateWithDuration:animations:completion:] lets us update our view properties within the `animations` block
- all iOS/UIkit views are backed by [`CALayer`][calayer]s, hence changing a `UIView` property is really changing a `CALayer` property
- when we change something within the `animations` block, [`CAAnimation`][CAAnimation] objects get added to each layer (whose property we're changing), and that's actually what's driving the animations that you see throughout iOS.

### Disabling animations

In case we're somehow within an `animations` block or similar, and we don't want to animate a property change, we have the following API:

```objc
(void)setAnimationsEnabled:(BOOL)
```

Which we need to remember to set back the value to `true` for other properties to animate. From iOS 7 we have a newer and recommended block-based API for this:

```objc
(void)performWithoutAnimation:(void ^(void))actions;
```

### Spring animations

Same as the basic animation, with two extra parameters:

- Damping ratio
- Initial Spring Velocity

```objc
+ (void)animateWithDuration:(NSTimeInterval)duration
                      delay:(NSTimeInterval)delay
     usingSpringWithDamping:(CGFloat)dampingRatio
      initialSpringVelocity:(CGFloat)velocity
                    options:(UIViewAnimationOptions)options
                 animations:(void (^)(void))animations
                 completion:(void (^)(BOOL finished))completion;
```

### Key-frame animations

Equivalent to `CAKeyframeAnimation`. We have two methods.

The first is to create the animation block as usual:

```objc
+ (void)animateKeyframesWithDuration:(NSTimeInterval)duration
                               delay:(NSTimeInterval)delay
                             options:(UIViewKeyframeAnimationOptions)options
                          animations:(void (^)(void))animations
                          completion:(void (^)(BOOL finished))completion;
```

The second is to add the actual key frames:

```objc
+ (void)addKeyframeWithRelativeStartTime:(double)frameStartTime
                        relativeDuration:(double)frameDuration
                              animations:(void (^)(void))animations
```

Example usage:

```objc
[UIView animateKeyframesWithDuration: .35
                               delay: 0.0
                             options:0
                          animations:^{
                                       [UIView addKeyframe... animations: ^{...}];
                                       [UIView addKeyframe... animations:^{...}];
                                       [UIView addKeyframe... animations:^{
                                         [someView setPosition:...];
                                          // etc. 
                                        }];
                                      }
                        completion:^(BOOL finished) {...}];
```

## Custom view controller transitions

Which transitions can be customized?

- Presentations and dismissals
- `UITabBarController`
- `UINavigationController`
- `UICollectionViewController` layout-to-layout transitions

### Presentations and dismissals

Supported presentation styles:

- `UIModalPresentationFullScreen`
- `UIModalPresentationCustom`

The difference between the two is that in `.custom` the `from` view controller is not removed from the window hierarchy after the transition.

How to:

```objc
UIViewController *vc = ...;
id <UIViewControllerTransitioningDelegate> transitioningDelegate;
vc.modalPresentationStyle = UIModalPresentationCustom;
[vc setTransitioningDelegate: transitioningDelegate];
[self presentViewController:vc animated: YES completion: nil];
```

### `UITabBarController` & `UINavigationController`

How to: set a delegate that vends the transition object

```objc
// in your UITabBarController subclass
NSUInteger secondTab = 1;
self.delegate = tabBarControllerDelegate;
[self setSelectedIndex:secondTab]; // this will use custom transition if `tabBarControllerDelegate` vends it

// in your UINavigationController subclass
self.delegate = navigationControllerDelegate;
[self pushViewController:vc animated:YES];
```

> Note that you don't need to subclass like in the example, you can use the default classes and assign the delegate.

### `UICollectionViewController`

Layout-to-layout navigation transitions

```objc
UICollectionViewLayout *layout1,*layout2,*layout3;
UICollectionViewController *cvc1, *cvc2, *cvc3;
cvc1 = [cvc1 initWithCollectionViewLayout:layout1];
...
[nav pushViewController:cvc1 animated:YES];
cvc2.useLayoutToLayoutNavigationTransitions = YES; // you must set these to get your transition
cvc3.useLayoutToLayoutNavigationTransitions = YES; // you must set these to get your transition
[nav pushViewController:cvc2 animated:YES];
[nav pushViewController:cvc3 animated:YES];
[nav popViewControllerAnimated:YES];
```

## Anatomy of a transition

In this transition, we replace the `Child A` view with a different `Child B` view:

| ![][startState] | ![][endState] |

> Blue is the view hierarchy, yellow is the view controller hierarchy

By definition, the start state and end state have both a view controller hierarchy and view hierarchy that are consistent.

However, during the transition between these states (the actual move from one to the other), we go through an inconsistent phase. For example, at some point we probably have both `Child A` and `Child B` views in the view hierarchy, maybe with some animations happening etc.

This can be considered a summary of what happens during a transition:

1. Start state (consistent view controller hierarchy and view hierarchy)
2. User or programmatic transition commences
3. Internal structures are updated, callbacks made, etc.
4. Container view, and start and final view positions are computed
5. Optional animation to end state view hierarchy is run
6. Animation completes (internal structures are updated, callbacks made, etc.) 
7. End State (consistent view controller hierarchy and view hierarchy)

## `UIViewControllerContextTransitioning`

From iOS 7, we have a new definition that takes care of points <kbd>4</kbd> and <kbd>6</kbd>: [`UIViewControllerContextTransitioning`][UIViewControllerContextTransitioning].

```objc
@protocol UIViewControllerContextTransitioning <NSObject>
  // The view in which the animated transition should take place.
  - (UIView *)containerView;

  // Two keys for the  method below are currently defined by the system
  // UITransitionContextToViewControllerKey, and UITransitionContextFromViewControllerKey.
  - (UIViewController *) viewControllerForKey:(NSString *)key;
  - (CGRect) initialFrameForViewController:(UIViewController *)vc;
  - (CGRect) finalFrameForViewController:(UIViewController *)vc;
  // üëÜüèª It's important to start and end from where the system wants you to start and end.

  // This MUST be called whenever a transition completes (or is cancelled.)
  - (void)completeTransition:(BOOL)didComplete;
  ...
@end
```

Note that we do not conform or create objects conforming to this protocol: it's UIKit that does this for us. Instead, an object conforming to this protocol will be passed to us to create and vend to create your custom transitions. 

## `UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning`

One object that we can define and where an `UIViewControllerContextTransitioning` object will be passed to is an object conforming to [`UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning`][UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning]:

```objc
@protocol UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning <NSObject>
  // Here we tell how long the transition is going to take.
  - (NSTimeInterval)transitionDuration:(id <UIViewControllerContextTransitioning>)ctx;

  // This method can only  be a nop if the transition is interactive and not a
  // percentDriven interactive transition.
  // Here we define the transition.
  - (void)animateTransition:(id <UIViewControllerContextTransitioning>)ctx;
  // üëÜüèª when this is called we need to:
  // 1. add the view into the parent view
  // 2. do our animation
  // 3. call `UIViewControllerContextTransitioning`'s completeTransition:

  @optional
  // This is a convenience and if implemented will be invoked by the system when the
  //transition context's completeTransition: method is invoked.
  - (void)animationEnded:(BOOL) transitionCompleted;
@end
```

Pseudo code for `animateTransition:`:

```objc
- (void)animateTransition:(id <UIViewControllerContextTransitioning>ctx {
  UIView *inView = [ctx containerView];
  UIView *toView = [[ctx viewControllerForKey: ...]  view];
  UIView *fromView = [[ctx viewControllerForKey: ...] view];
  CGSize size = toEndFrame.size;
  
  if(self.isPresentation) {
    ...
    [inView addSubview: toView];
  } else { 
    ...
    [inView insertSubview:toView belowSubview: [fromVC view]];
  }

  // üëáüèª Do the animation here 
  [UIView animateWithDuration: self.transitionDuration animations: ^ {
    if(self.isPresentation) {
      toView.center = newCenter;
      toView.bounds = newBounds;
    } else {
      ...
    } 
  } completion: ^(BOOL finished) { [ctx completeTransition: YES];}];
}
```

## Wiring it all together

- Animation and interaction controllers are vended by delegates

  - `UIViewControllerTransitioningDelegate`
  - `UINavigationControllerDelegate`
  - `UITabBarControllerDelegate`

- Animation controllers conform to `UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning`
- Interaction controllers conform to `UIViewControllerInteractiveTransitioning`
- A system object passed to the controllers conforms to `UIViewControllerContextTransitioning`

## Animation and interaction controllers are vended by delegates

### `UIViewControllerTransitioningDelegate`

We vend our animated/interactive transition via this delegate:

```objc
@protocol UIViewControllerTransitioningDelegate <NSObject>
  // for animated but not interactive:
  @optional
  - (id <UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning>)
      animationControllerForPresentedController:(UIVC *)presented
                            presentingController:(UIVC *)presenting
                                sourceController:(UIVC *)source;
  - (id <UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning>)
      animationControllerForDismissedController:(UIVC *)dismissed;

  // for animated and interactive:
  - (id <UIViewControllerInteractiveTransitioning>)
      interactionControllerForPresentation:(id <UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning>)a;
  - (id <UIViewControllerInteractiveTransitioning>)
      interactionControllerForDismissal:(id <UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning>)a;
@end
```

..which we set in the **presented** view controller (not the presenting view controller):

```objc
@interface UIViewController(CustomTransitioning)
  @property (nonatomic,retain) id <UIViewControllerTransitioningDelegate>transitionDelegate;
@end
```

### `UINavigationControllerDelegate`

Similar to above, here are the new `UINavigationControllerDelegate` extensions:

```objc
// animated but not interactive:
- (id <UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning>)navigationController:  (UINC *)nc
                                   animationControllerForOperation: (UINavigationControllerOperation)op
                                                fromViewController:(UIViewController *)fromVC
                                                  toViewController:(UIViewController *)toVC;
// animated and interactive:
- (id <UIViewControllerInteractiveTransitioning>)navigationController: (UINC *)nc
                          interactionControllerForAnimationController: (id <UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning>)a;
```

### `UITabBarControllerDelegate`

Here are the new `UITabBarControllerDelegate` extensions:

```objc
// animated but not interactive:
- (id <UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning>)tabBarController: (UITABC *)tbc
            animationControllerForTransitionFromViewController:(UIVC *)fromVC
                                              toViewController:(UIVC *)toVC;
// animated and interactive:
- (id <UIViewControllerInteractiveTransitioning>)tabBarController: (UITABC *)tbc
                      interactionControllerForAnimationController: (id <UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning>)a;
```

### Responsibilities of the animation controller

- Implementation of `animateTransition:` and `transitionDuration:` 
  - Insertion of <kbd>to</kbd> view controller‚Äôs view into the container view

- When the transition animation completes
  - The <kbd>to</kbd> and <kbd>from</kbd> view controller‚Äôs views need to be in their designated positions
  - The context‚Äôs `completeTransition:` method must be invoked

## Interactive View Controller Transitions

- Like before, but interactive
- If you use a `UIView` animation APIs in your `animateTransition` method, UIKit will take care of reversing the animation, cancelling it, etc.
- UIKit provides a concrete interaction controller class: [`UIPercentDrivenInteractiveTransition`][UIPercentDrivenInteractiveTransition]

### `UIViewControllerInteractiveTransitioning`

Equivalent to `UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning`, but interactive.

```objc
@protocol UIViewControllerInteractiveTransitioning <NSObject>
  // fell free to call out to your animation controller's animate transmission here
  - (void)startInteractiveTransition:(id <UIViewControllerContextTransitioning>)ctx;
  
  // When the transition stops, you can use these parameters to tell the animation to speed up/slow down
  // and also change the animation curve.
  @optional
  - (CGFloat)completionSpeed;
  - (UIViewAnimationCurve)completionCurve;
@end
```

### Interactive Transitioning States

![][interactiveTransitioningStates]

### How-to

- Implement the animation controller
  - `animatePresentation:` must be implemented using the `UIView` animation block APIs

- Implement the logic that will drive the interaction (e.g. The target of a gesture recognizer)
  - Often this target is a subclass of `UIViewControllerPercentDrivenTransition`
  - The interaction logic will call:
    - `updateInteractiveTransition:(CGFloat)percent`
    - `completeInteractiveTransition` or `cancelInteractiveTransition`
    - (Note that `startInteractiveTransition` is handled automatically)

### `UIPercentDrivenInteractiveTransition`

```objc
// The associated animation controller must animate its transition using UIView animation APIs.
@interface UIPercentDrivenInteractiveTransition : NSObject <UIViewControllerInteractiveTransitioning>
  @property (readonly) CGFloat duration;
  // The last percentComplete value specified by updateInteractiveTransition:
  @property (readonly) CGFloat percentComplete;
  // completionSpeed defaults to 1.0 which corresponds to a completion duration of
  // (1 - percentComplete)*duration.  It must be greater than 0.0.
  @property (nonatomic,assign) CGFloat completionSpeed;
  // When the interactive part of the transition has completed, this property can
  // be set to indicate a different animation curve.
  @property (nonatomic,assign) UIViewAnimationCurve completionCurve;
 
  //üëáüèª These are the three methods that you're going to call.
  // Used instead of the corresponding context methods.
  - (void)updateInteractiveTransition:(CGFloat)percentComplete;
  - (void)cancelInteractiveTransition;
  - (void)finishInteractiveTransition;
@end
```

### Canceling an interactive transition

- Don‚Äôt assume that `viewDidAppear` follows `viewWillAppear`
  - because of interactive transactions, our view controller might jump between appearing (`viewWillAppear`) and disappearing (`viewWillDisappear`) without actually appearing and disappearing

- Make sure to undo any side effects

Any view controller can ask for the transition coordinator (doesn't matter which view controller, as long as they're involved in a transition)

```objc
@interface UIViewController(TransitionCoordinator)
@property (nonatomic,retain) id <UIViewControllerTransitionCoordinator> transitionCoordinator;
@end
```

This coordinator conforms to [`UIViewControllerTransitionCoordinator`][UIViewControllerTransitionCoordinator] which, in turn, conforms to [`UIViewControllerTransitionCoordinatorContext`][UIViewControllerTransitionCoordinatorContext]: 

```objc
@protocol UIViewControllerTransitionCoordinator
                      <UIViewControllerTransitionCoordinatorContext>
  @optional
  - (BOOL) notifyWhenInteractionEndsUsingBlock:(void (^ (id<UIViewControllerTransitionCoordinatorContext)handler;
  - (BOOL) animatorAlongsideTransition:(void (^) (id <UIViewControllerTransitionCoordinatorContext)a;
                            completion:(void (^)(id<UIViewControllerTransitionCoordinatorContext)c;
  - (BOOL) animatorAlongsideTransitionInView:(UIView *)view
                                   animation: (void (^) (id <UIViewControllerTransitionCoordinatorContext)a;
@end

@protocol UIViewControllerTransitionCoordinatorContext <NSObject>
  - (UIView *)containerView;
  - (UIViewController *) viewControllerForKey:(NSString *)key;
  - (CGRect) initialFrameForViewController:(UIViewController *)vc;
  - (CGRect) finalFrameForViewController:(UIViewController *)vc;
  - (BOOL) isCancelled;
  - (BOOL) initiallyInteractive;
  - (BOOL) isInteractive;
@end
```

Your view controller can use these properties of the coordinator to keep track of its own appearing/disappearing state. For example:

```objc
- (void) viewWillAppear: {
  [self doSomeSideEffectsAssumingViewDidAppearIsGoingToBeCalled];
  id <UIViewControllerTransitionCoordinator> coordinator;
  coordinator = [self transitionCoordinator];
  if(coordinator && [coordinator initiallyInteractive]) {
    [transitionCoordinator notifyWhenInteractionEndsUsingBlock:
      ^(id <UIViewControllerTransitionCoordinatorContext> ctx) {
        if(ctx.isCancelled) {
          [self undoSideEffects];
        }
      }];
  }
}
```

`transitionCoordinator` does even more:

- Allows completion handlers to be registered for transitions
- Allows other animations to run alongside the transition animation ‚Ä¢ In addition to custom transitions on iOS 7
- `UINavigationController` transitions have an associated transition coordinator
- Present and Dismiss transitions have an associated coordinator

Usage example:

```objc
UIViewController *vc;
[self pushViewController:vc animated: YES];
id <UIViewControllerTransitionCoordinator>coordinator;
coordinator = [viewController transitionCoordinator];
[coordinator animateAlongsideTransition:
  ^(id <UIViewControllerTransitionCoordinatorContext> c) {
    ;;; some animation
  }
  completion:(id <UIViewControllerTransitionCoordinatorContext> c) {
    ;;; Code to run after your push transition has finished.
}];
```
