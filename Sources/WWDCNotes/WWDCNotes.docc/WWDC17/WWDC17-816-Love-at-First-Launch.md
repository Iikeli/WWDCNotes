# Love at First Launch

Engage people from the first moment they open your app, and keep them coming back for more. Learn tips on how to make a compelling first impression, methods for teaching new users about your app, and best practices when asking users for more information.

At first app launch, lead with great content:

- do not make the user start their journey with a sign-in wall
- let the user browse and use the app first
- ask for sign-in only when necessary (e.g. before booking a place, or ordering food)

Teach through interaction:

- strive to design your interfaces to be as intuitive and as easy to understand as possible
- ideally, no upfront instruction is needed at all (no on-boarding, tool tips, etc)

Delay permission requests for more data:

- do not ask for camera, location, heathKit, etc. permission at app launch
- make requests on an as-needed basis
- ensure people understand the value of sharing their private data with you, ideally before you ask for it
- Once that permission has been granted, reinforce the decision by showing off the benefits you'll provide with that data
