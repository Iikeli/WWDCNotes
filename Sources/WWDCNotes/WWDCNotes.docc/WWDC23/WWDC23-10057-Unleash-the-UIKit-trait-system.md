# Unleash the UIKit trait system

Discover powerful enhancements to the trait system in UIKit. Learn how you can define custom traits to add your own data to UITraitCollection, modify the data propagated to view controllers and views with trait override APIs, and adopt APIs to improve flexibility and performance. Weâ€™ll also show you how to bridge UIKit traits with SwiftUI environment keys to seamlessly access data from both UIKit and SwiftUI components in your app.
