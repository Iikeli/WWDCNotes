# Meet Push Notifications Console

The Push Notifications Console is the best way to quickly test user notifications in your app. Learn how you can iterate on new ideas quickly by sending notifications directly from the console and analyze delivery logs to learn more about your pushes. Weâ€™ll also show you how to generate and validate tokens to successfully authenticate with Apple Push Notification service (APNs).

To get the most out of this session, you should have a basic understanding of Apple Push Notification service (APNs) and user notifications.
