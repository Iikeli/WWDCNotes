# Explore materials in Reality Composer Pro

Learn how Reality Composer Pro can help you alter the appearance of your 3D objects using RealityKit materials. We‚Äôll introduce you to MaterialX and physically-based (PBR) shaders, show you how to design dynamic materials using the shader graph editor, and explore adding custom inputs to a material so that you can control it in your visionOS app.

To get the most out of this session, we recommend first watching ‚ÄúMeet Reality Composer Pro.‚Äù Once you‚Äôre ready to learn how you can incorporate your models and materials into an Xcode project, check out "Work with Reality Composer Pro content in Xcode."
