# Detect animal poses in Vision

Go beyond detecting cats and dogs in images. We‚Äôll show you how to use Vision to detect the individual joints and poses of these animals as well ‚Äî all in real time ‚Äî and share how you can enable exciting features like animal tracking for a camera app, creative embellishment on an animal photo, and more. We‚Äôll also explore other important enhancements to Vision and share best practices.
