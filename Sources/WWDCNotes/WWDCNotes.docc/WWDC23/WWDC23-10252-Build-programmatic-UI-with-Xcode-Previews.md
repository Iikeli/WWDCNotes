# Build programmatic UI with Xcode Previews

Learn how you can use the #Preview macro on Xcode 15 to quickly iterate on your UI code written in SwiftUI, UIKit, or AppKit. Explore a collage of unique workflows for interacting with views right in the canvas, find out how to view multiple variations of UI simultaneously, and discover how you can travel through your widgetâ€™s timeline in seconds to test the transitions between entries. Weâ€™ll also show you how to add previews to libraries, provide sample assets, and preview your views in your physical devices to leverage their capabilities and existing data.
