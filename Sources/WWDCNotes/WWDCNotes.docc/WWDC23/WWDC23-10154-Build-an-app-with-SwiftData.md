# Build an app with SwiftData

Discover how SwiftData can help you persist data in your app. Code along with us as we bring SwiftData to a multi-platform SwiftUI app. Learn how to convert existing model classes into SwiftData models, set up the environment, reflect model layer changes in UI, and build document-based applications backed by SwiftData storage.

To get the most out of this session, you should be familiar SwiftData. For an introduction, check out "Meet SwiftData" from WWDC23.
