# Expand on Swift macros

Discover how Swift macros can help you reduce boilerplate in your codebase and adopt complex features more easily. Learn how macros can analyze code, emit rich compiler errors to guide developers towards correct usage, and generate new code that is automatically incorporated back into your project. Weâ€™ll also take you through important concepts like macro roles, compiler plugins, and syntax trees.
