# Integrate your media app with HomePod

Learn how people can interact with your media app directly from HomePod. Weâ€™ll show you how to add a media intent to your iPhone or iPad app and help people stream your content to a HomePod speaker over AirPlay simply by using their voice. Explore implementation details and get tips and best practices on how to create a great experience for music, audiobooks, podcasts, meditations, or other media types.

## Overview

Overview of the data flow when requesting Siri to play a song via HomePod:

![][dataflow]

- The device must be connected to the same network as the HomePod.
- The device doesn't need to be physically near the person who is speaking.
- Any app supporting SiriKit Media Intents today will be able to use this capability with no additional changes.
- Supported options:
    - Play media
        - Music, audiobooks, podcasts, radio, meditation, and more.
    - Add to playlist or library
    - Show affinity (e.g. like/dislike)
- "Add to playlist" and "like/dislike" actions will use voice recognition to identify the user, and the user's primary device (as configured on Find My) will be used to perform the action.

## Example requests

## Example code to resolve intents

```swift
class IntentHandler: INExtension, INPlayMediaIntentHandling {
    // INPlayMediaIntent methods
    func resolveMediaItems(for intent: INPlayMediaIntent, with completion: @escaping ([INPlayMediaMediaItemResolutionResult]) -> Void) {
        guard intent.mediaSearch?.mediaType != .genre else {
            return completion([INPlayMediaMediaItemResolutionResult.unsupported(forReason: .unsupportedMediaType) ])
        }
        if intent.mediaSearch?.mediaName == "push it" {
            let item = INMediaItem(identifier: "sample", title: "Push it", type: song, artwork: nil)
            return completion(INPlayMediaMediaItemResolutionResult.successes(with: [item]))
        }
        completion([INPlayMediaMediaItemResolutionResult.unsupported()])
    }
}
```

When handling intent, you can return two types of responses, `.handleInApp`, which will instruct the system to start the app and play in the background, and `.continueInApp`, which does the same in foreground. To offer a better experience, handle the request in backgroud using `.handleInApp` since it doesn't require the user to unlock their phone.

Make sure your app responds all intents as fast as possible. Requests will timeout after 10 seconds.
