# Generalize APIs with parameter packs

Swift parameter packs are a powerful tool to expand what is possible in your generic code while also enabling you to simplify common generic patterns.

To get the most out of this session, we recommend first checking out â€œEmbrace Swift generics" from WWDC22.
