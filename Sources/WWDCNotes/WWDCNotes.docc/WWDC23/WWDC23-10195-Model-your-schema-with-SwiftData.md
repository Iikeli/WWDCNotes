# Model your schema with SwiftData

Learn how to use schema macros and migration plans with SwiftData to build more complex features for your app. Weâ€™ll show you how to fine-tune your persistence with @Attribute and @Relationship options. Learn how to exclude properties from your data model with @Transient and migrate from one version of your schema to the next with ease.

To get the most out of this session, we recommend first watching "Meet SwiftData" and "Build an app with SwiftData" from WWDC23.
