# Analyze hangs with Instruments

User interface elements often mimic real-world interactions, including real-time responses. Apps with a noticeable delay in user interaction â€” a hang â€” can break that illusion and create frustration. Weâ€™ll show you how to use Instruments to analyze, understand, and fix hangs in your apps on all Apple platforms. Discover how you can efficiently navigate an Instruments trace document, interpret trace data, and record additional profiling data to better understand your specific hang.

If you arenâ€™t familiar with using Instruments, we recommend first watching "Getting Started with Instruments." And to learn about other tools that can help you discover hangs in your app, check out "Track down hangs with Xcode and on-device detection."
