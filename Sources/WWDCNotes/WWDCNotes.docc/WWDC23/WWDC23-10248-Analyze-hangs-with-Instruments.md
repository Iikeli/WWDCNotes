Apps with a noticeable delay in user interaction â€” a hang â€” can break that illusion and create frustration. Weâ€™ll show you how to use Instruments to analyze, understand, and fix hangs in your apps on all Apple platforms. Discover how you can efficiently navigate an Instruments trace document, interpret trace data, and record additional profiling data to better understand your specific hang.
