## Intro

- ShazamKit is a framework that can bring audio recognition into your apps.
- You can match against Shazam's music catalogs, or your own custom prerecorded audios.

## Overview

![ShazamKit match flow][match]

Thus, the implementation overview is rather simple:

1. Ask for microphone permission from the user.
2. Start recording.
3. Pass the recorded audio buffers to ShazamKit.
4. Handle the results from ShazamKit.

## New this year

- `SHManagedSession`: automatically handles recording, removing the hassle of setting up audio buffers, managing the recording session, and checking for microphone permission (although microphone permission is still required).
- You can call `prepare()` to start prerecording ahead of time, so matches return faster when asked.
- `SHManagedSession` has 3 states:
    - `idle`: the session has completed a single match result, or was cancelled, or terminated async sequence of results.
    - `prerecording`: `prepare()` was called.
    - `matching`: session is making at least 1 match attempt.

- `SHLibrary`: add media items to the Shazam library, list the items you (and not any other app!) have added, and delete them.
