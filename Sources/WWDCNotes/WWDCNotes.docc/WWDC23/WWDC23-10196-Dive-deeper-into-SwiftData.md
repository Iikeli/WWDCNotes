# Dive deeper into SwiftData

Learn how you can harness the power of SwiftData in your app. Find out how ModelContext and ModelContainer work together to persist your appâ€™s data. Weâ€™ll show you how to track and make your changes manually and use SwiftData at scale with FetchDescriptor, SortDescriptor, and enumerate.

To get the most out of this session, we recommend first watching "Meet SwiftData" and "Model your schema with SwiftData" from WWDC23.
