# Meet Object Capture for iOS

Discover how you can offer an end-to-end Object Capture experience directly in your iOS apps to help people turn their objects into ready-to-use 3D models. Learn how you can create a fully automated Object Capture scan flow with our sample app and how you can assist people in automatically capturing the best content for their model. Weâ€™ll also discuss LiDAR data and provide best practices for scanning objects.
