# Create accessible Single App Mode experiences

Learn how you can provide more control and accessibility to people using your apps in Single App Mode. Weâ€™ll share how you can use the UIAccessibility and Automatic Assessment Configuration frameworks to apply these restrictions when needed and enable these accessibility features without ever opening the Settings app. Weâ€™ll also take you through how you can add custom restrictions within your app to better support the Guided Access feature in iOS, which puts any app into Single App Mode temporarily.
