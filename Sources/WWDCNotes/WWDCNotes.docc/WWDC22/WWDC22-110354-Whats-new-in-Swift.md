![Sketchnote about news in swift from WWDC 22 with community updates, news for swifts packages, performance improvements, concurrency updates and info to expressive swift][sketchnote]

## Community updates

Two new work groups:

- [Swift Website (SWWG)](https://www.swift.org/website-workgroup/)
- [C++ Interoperability](https://forums.swift.org/t/swift-and-c-interoperability-workgroup-announcement/54998)

Year-round mentorships from now on [Swift.org/diversity](http://Swift.org/diversity) has more details.

Cross-platform support:

- support for Linux package formats: new native (experimental) toolchain installers for Amazon Linux 2 and CentOS 7

Swift news:

- dropped dependency on an external Unicode support library, replaced with a faster native implementation
- this has made Swift smaller, useful when Swift is statically linked (e.g., in containerized deployments for the server)
- now used in Apple's Secure Enclave Processor

## Swift Packages Updates

- Trust on first use (TOFU)
  - new security protocol where the fingerprint of a package is now being recorded when the package is first downloaded
  - subsequent downloads will validate this fingerprint and report an error if the fingerprints are different

### Plugins

Command plugins:

- first step in providing more extensible and secure build tools
- can be used for documentation generation, source code reformatting, and more

Example:

```swift
import PackagePlugin

/// You define a plug-in by creating a struct that conforms to the CommandPlugin protocol.
@main struct MyPlugin: CommandPlugin {

  // Add a function that tells your plug-in which tool you'd like to invoke
  func performCommand(context: PluginContext, arguments: [String]) throws {
    let process = try Process.run(doccExec, arguments: doccArgs) // here we call our tool, in this case DocC
    process.waitUntilExit()
  }

}
```

DocC: Objective-C and C support

Build tool plugins:

- plugins that can implement additional build steps
- similar to Xcode Rules
- example: source code generation, resource processing

Example:

```swift
import PackagePlugin

@main struct MyCoolPlugin: BuildToolPlugin {
  func createBuildCommands(context: TargetBuildContext) throws -> [Command] {

    let generatedSources = context.pluginWorkDirectory.appending("GeneratedSources")

    return [
      .buildCommand(
        displayName: "Running MyTool",
        executable: try context.tool(named: "mycooltool").path,
        arguments: ["create"],
        outputFilesDirectory: generatedSources)
    ]
  }
}
```

Plugins are declared in a new <kbd>Plugins</kbd> folder in the root of our Package, plugins are treated as Swift executables.

### Module aliasing

- solves module collisions (when two separate packages define a module with the same name)
- allows you to rename modules from outside the packages that define them

```swift
let package = Package(
  name: "MyStunningApp",
  dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://.../swift-metrics.git"),
    .package(url: "https://.../swift-log.git") // ‚ö†Ô∏è swift-log and swift-metric define a Logging module
  ],
  targets: [
    .executableTarget(
      name: "MyStunningApp",
      dependencies: [
        .product(name: "Logging", package: "swift-log"),
        .product(name: "Metrics", package: "swift-metrics",
                 moduleAliases: ["Logging": "MetricsLogging"]), // üëàüèª module aliasing
])])
```

## Performance improvements

- Built-time improvements
  - faster type-checking for generics

- Runtime improvements
  - optimized protocol conformance checking
    - protocol checking on app startup take as long as four seconds
    - from Swift 5.7, these checks are cached
    - for apps that rely heavily on Swift, this means launch-time can be up to twice as fast

### Swift driver

- program that coordinates the compilation of Swift source code in Swift
- rewritten in Swift (last year)
- can now be used as a framework directly inside the Xcode build system instead of as a separate executable
- this allows it to coordinate builds more closely with the build system to allow things like parallelization
- build times improvements around 5-25%

## Concurrency updates

- further fleshed out the model with data race safety at the forefront
- `distributed` actors
  - actors in different machines with a network between them
  - can write a safe backend for your app in Swift
  - note that a distributed actor call can potentially fail because of network errors
  - [new open source Distributed Actors package][swift-distributed-actors] that is focused on building server-side, clustered distributed systems in Swift 
    - integrated networking layer using SwiftNIO
    - implements the [SWIM consensus protocol][SWIM_Protocol] to manage state across the cluster

```swift
distributed actor Player {
   
  var ai: PlayerBotAI?
  var gameState: GameState
  
  distributed func makeMove() -> GameMove {
    return ai.decideNextMove(given: &gameState)
  }
}
```

- [Async Algorithms Package][aap]
  - seamless integration with `async/await`
  - home for time-based algorithms using `AsyncSequence`
  - support for Apple platforms, Linux, and Windows

- Actor prioritization
  - actors now execute the highest-priority work first

- new Swift concurrency instruments 
  - Swift Concurrency view helps you investigate performance issues
  - Swift Tasks and Swift Actors instruments provide a full suite of tools to help you visualize and optimize your concurrency code
    - provides useful statistics such as the number of tasks running simultaneously, total tasks that have been created up until that point in time
    - graphical representation of the parent-child relationships between tasks in structured concurrent code

## What's new in Swift 5.7

> Refer to [Apple's Swift repository CHANGELOG](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/5fbede201a3e83d1957458060b6fbddf29494746/CHANGELOG.md#swift-57).

- `if let x = x` becomes `if let x` (optional unwrapping)
- No need to manually specify a closures result type (closure type inference)
- Permitted pointer conversion currently:

|   | Swift | C |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `UnsafePointer<UInt64> const uint64 t *` ‚ÜîÔ∏è `UnsafePointer<Int64> const int64 t*` | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |
| `UnsafePointer<mailmap_t> const mailmap_t *` ‚ÜîÔ∏è `UnsafePointer<UInt8> const char *` | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |
| `UnsafeRawPointer const void *` ‚ÜîÔ∏è `UnsafePointer<UInt8> const char *` | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |

- Pointer mismatches still possible when passing to C
- C++ working group works on improving the interoperation
- Special treatment for enabling conversions easily

|   | Swift | C | Swift calling C |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `UnsafePointer<UInt64> const uint64 t *` ‚ÜîÔ∏è `UnsafePointer<Int64> const int64 t*` | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| `UnsafePointer<mailmap_t> const mailmap_t *` ‚ÜîÔ∏è `UnsafePointer<UInt8> const char *` | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| `UnsafeRawPointer const void *` ‚ÜîÔ∏è `UnsafePointer<UInt8> const char *` | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |

- String parsing currently is hard (especially indices)
- ‚Äúthe problem is not the indices expression, it‚Äôs the whole function‚Äù
- Answer: Use Regexes!
- Literals supported now with compile-time checks

```swift
func parseLine(_ line: Substring) throws -> MailmapEntry {
  let regex = /\h*([^<#]+?)??\h*<([^>#]+)>\h*(?:#|\Z)/
  
  guard let match = line.prefixMatch(of: regex) else {
    throw MailmapError.badLine
  }
  
  return MailmapEntry(name: match.1, email: match.2)
}
```

- For those who find Regexes hard to read, new DSL:

```swift
import RegexBuilder

let regex = Regex {
  ZeroOrMore(.horizontalWhitespace)
  Optionally {
    Capture (OneOrMore(.noneOf("<#")))
  }
  .repetitionBehavior(.reluctant)

  ZeroOrMore(.horizontalWhitespace)
  "<"
  Capture (OneOrMore(.noneOf(">#")))
  ">"
  ZeroOrMore(.horizontalWhitespace)
  ChoiceOf {
    "ÔºÉ"
    Anchor.endOfSubjectBeforeNewline
  }
}
```

- Requires `import RegexBuilder`
- Not a beginner-only feature
    - turn into reusable `RegexComponent`, use from other regexes, even are recursive
    - no special escaping needed
    - support literals inside of the builder
    - types can implement custom parsing logic, like `Date`

- `Regex` supports useful matching functions
- Custom engine written in Swift
- Compatible with UTS #18 unicode standard
- Available in macOS 13, iOS 16, tvOS 16, watchOS 9

### Generic code clarity 

Assume `Mailmap` is our generic:

| Something that conforms to Mailmap | A box whose contents conform to Mailmap |
| --- | --- |
| `struct EditableMailmap: Mailmap` | `var map: Mailmap` |
| `<Value: Mailmap>` | `Array<Mailmap>` |
| `where Element: Mailmap` | `where Element == Mailmap` |
| `some Mailmap` | `(Mailmap) -> Mailmap` |

We can be more expressive with any:


| Something that conforms to Mailmap | A box whose contents conform to Mailmap |
| --- | --- |
| `struct EditableMailmap: Mailmap` | `var map: any Mailmap` |
| `<Value: Mailmap>` | `Array<any Mailmap>` |
| `where Element: Mailmap` | `where Element == any Mailmap` |
| `some Mailmap` | `(any Mailmap) -> any Mailmap` |


- easier to explain the difference between methods and understand errors
- Swift will now ‚Äúopen the box‚Äù for us, so less ‚Äúcannot conform to‚Äù errors
- Swift 5.7 fixes the ‚Äúonly be used as a generic constraint‚Äù error
- you can now specify the types in parameter, without the need to a `where` clause using ‚Äúprimary associated type‚Äù

```swift
protocol Collection<Element>: Sequence {
  associatedtype Index: Comparable
  associatedtype Iterator: IteratorProtocol<Element>
  associatedtype SubSequence: Collection<Element> where SubSequence.Index == Index, SubSequence.SubSequence == SubSequence

  associatedtype Element
}
```

- `AnyCollection` is a type-erasing wrapper, serves same purpose of `any`
- `any` is a built-in language feature that makes type-erasing wrappers no longer needed in many cases
- suggestion: replace your wrappers with typealiases, e.g. `let AnyCollection = any Collection` to keep backwards-compatibility (easier migration)
- Improvements to `any` types, but still have important limitations
- Don‚Äôt use `any` all the time, use generics instead, use the top one for better performance (generics)

```swift
func addEntries1<Entries: Collection<MailmapEntry>, Map: Mailmap>(_ entries: Entries, to mailmap: inout MailMap) {
  for entry in entries {
    mailmap.addEntry(entry)
  }
}

func addEntries2(_ entries: any Collection<MailmapEntry>, to mailmap: inout any Mailmap) {
  for entry in entries {
    mailmap.addEntry(entry)
  }
}
```

- `some ProtocolName` supported in more places, simplifies definition of Generics (simplifies above example, just write `some` instead of `any`)

```swift
func addEntries1(_ entries: some Collection<MailmapEntry>, to mailmap: inout some MailMap) {
  for entry in entries {
    mailmap.addEntry(entry)
  }
}

func addEntries2(_ entries: any Collection<MailmapEntry>, to mailmap: inout any Mailmap) {
  for entry in entries {
    mailmap.addEntry(entry)
  }
}
```
