# Integrate your custom collaboration app with Messages

Discover how the SharedWithYou framework can augment your app's collaboration infrastructure. We'll show you how to send secure invitations to collaborative content and synchronize participant changes. We'll also cover displaying content updates within the relevant conversation.

For an introduction to SharedWithYou, watch "Add Shared with You to your app" from WWDC22. For an overview of the collaboration UI APIs, watch "Enhance collaboration experiences with Messages" from WWDC22.

(Note: API will be available in an upcoming beta.)
