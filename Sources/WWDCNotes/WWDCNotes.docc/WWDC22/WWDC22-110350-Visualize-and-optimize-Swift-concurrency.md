# Visualize and optimize Swift concurrency

Learn how you can optimize your app with the Swift Concurrency template in Instruments. We'll discuss common performance issues and show you how to use Instruments to find and resolve these problems. Learn how you can keep your UI responsive, maximize parallel performance, and analyze Swift concurrency activity within your app.

To get the most out of this session, we recommend familiarity with Swift concurrency (including tasks and actors).
