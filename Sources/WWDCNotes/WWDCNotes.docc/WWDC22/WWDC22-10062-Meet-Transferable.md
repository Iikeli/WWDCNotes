# Meet Transferable

Meet Transferable: a model-layer protocol that allows for effortless support for sharing, drag and drop, copy/paste, and other features in your app.

We'll explore how you can use the API for common use cases, and take advantage of advanced features to customize the behavior. We'll also share how you can optimize for memory efficiency when dealing with large amounts of data. Whether you're extending your models to share with other applications as strings or images or creating custom declared data types, Transferable can help you facilitate a great experience in your app.
