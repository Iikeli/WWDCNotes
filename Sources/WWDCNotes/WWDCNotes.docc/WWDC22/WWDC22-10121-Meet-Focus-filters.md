# Meet Focus filters

Discover how you can customize app behaviors based on someone's currently enabled Focus. We'll show you how to use App Intents to define your app's Focus filters, act on changes from the system, and present your app's views in different ways. We'll also explore how you can filter notifications and update badge counts.

To get the most out of this session, we recommend first watching "Dive into App Intents" from WWDC22.
