# Design protocol interfaces in Swift

Learn how you can use Swift 5.7 to design advanced abstractions using protocols. We'll show you how to use existential types, explore how you can separate implementation from interface with opaque result types, and share the same-type requirements that can help you identify and guarantee relationships between concrete types.

To get the most out of this session, we recommend first watching â€œEmbrace Swift generics" from WWDC22.
