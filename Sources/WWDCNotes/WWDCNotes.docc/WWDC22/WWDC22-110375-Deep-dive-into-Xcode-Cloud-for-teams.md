# Deep dive into Xcode Cloud for teams

Learn how you can use Apple‚Äôs continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) service with development teams of any size to help you deliver high-quality apps. We‚Äôll show you how to integrate Xcode Cloud into your team‚Äôs existing app development process and efficiently use Xcode Cloud in your CI/CD practice. We‚Äôll also demonstrate how you can use the App Store Connect API to integrate Xcode Cloud with an issue tracker, explore code dependency management, and share best practices.

To get the most out of this session, we recommend first watching ‚ÄúCustomize your advanced Xcode Cloud workflows‚Äù from WWDC21.
