# Dive into App Intents

Learn how you can make your app more discoverable and increase app engagement when you use the App Intents framework. We'll take you through the powerful capabilities of this Swift framework, explore the differences between App Intents and SiriKit Intents, and show you how you can expose your app's functionality to the system. We'll also share how you can build entities and queries to create rich App Shortcuts experiences.
