# Enhance collaboration experiences with Messages

Discover how you can help improve communication and collaboration in your app with Collaboration in Messages. Learn how to tie a document to Messages conversations for simple sharing and discussion. Explore how you can keep everyone in the conversation up to date on the latest activity in the document. And find out how you can add customizable UI in your app to manage collaboration details and connect documents to Messages conversations and FaceTime calls.
