# Meet Apple Maps Server APIs

Simplify your appâ€™s mapping architecture by implementing the Apple Maps stack across MapKit, MapKit JS, and Apple Maps Server APIs. Learn how these APIs can reduce network calls and increase power efficiency, which can help improve the overall performance of your app. We'll show you how to use geocoding and estimated time of arrival APIs to build functionality for a simple store locator, and explore the API authentication flow.
