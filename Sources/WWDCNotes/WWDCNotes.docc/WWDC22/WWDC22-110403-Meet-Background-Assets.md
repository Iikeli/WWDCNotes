# Meet Background Assets

Discover how you can use the Background Assets framework to download large files directly from your CDN and improve the initial launch experience of your apps and games. Weâ€™ll show you how to schedule background downloads during initial app install, app updates, and periodically as someone uses the app. Weâ€™ll also explore how you can manage scheduled downloads to make sure people have the content they want, when they want it.
