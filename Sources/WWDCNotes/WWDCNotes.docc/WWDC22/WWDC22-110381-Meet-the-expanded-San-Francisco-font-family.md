# Meet the expanded San Francisco font family

Discover the latest additions to San Francisco – the system font for Apple platforms – and find out how they can provide more control and versatility when designing interfaces. In addition to weights and optical sizes, San Francisco now supports three new width styles: Condensed, Compressed, and Expanded. We’ll also take you through the linguistic expansion of San Francisco and learn more about the feature-rich Arabic system font families: SF Arabic and SF Arabic Rounded.

- Styles towards center have more neutral voice
- Outside ones more expressive and stronger voice
- Choosing & pairing fonts:
    - All styles provide same language support
    - Vertical proportions are always the same for all
    - Stem thickness stays relatively the same
    - Regular: Is best to read, default to this
    - Condensed: Comfortable width, but fit more text
    - Compressed: Very densed proportions, nice as a display style
    - Expanded: Use on smaller labels and secondary content
    - Either you can save space, or use larger size with same space
    - Don’t use “Compressed” for long texts due to bad legibility

- Example combinations:
    - Photos app combines Compressed Semibold for Title, Expanded Bold for Subtitle
    - A world of possible combinations:

- News app uses Condensed or Compressed for title to fit more in, giving the title personality
- Expanded used for author
- Maps app uses expanded for long mountains to fill greater space, for example

- Recap:
    - Space efficiency
    - Reinforce hierarchies
