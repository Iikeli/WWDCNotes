# Optimize your Core ML usage

Learn how Core ML works with the CPU, GPU, and Neural Engine to power on-device, privacy-preserving machine learning experiences for your apps. We‚Äôll explore the latest tools for understanding and maximizing the performance of your models. We‚Äôll also show you how to generate reports to easily understand your model performance characteristics, help you gain insight into your models with the Core ML Instrument, and take you through API enhancements to further optimize Core ML integration in your apps.

To get the most out of this session, be sure to watch ‚ÄúTune your Core ML models‚Äù from WWDC21.
