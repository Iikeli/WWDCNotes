# Compose custom layouts with SwiftUI

SwiftUI now offers powerful tools to level up your layouts and arrange views for your appâ€™s interface. Weâ€™ll introduce you to the Grid container, which helps you create highly customizable, two-dimensional layouts, and show you how you can use the Layout protocol to build your own containers with completely custom behavior. Weâ€™ll also explore how you can create seamless animated transitions between your layout types, and share tips and best practices for creating great interfaces.
