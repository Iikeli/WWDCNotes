# Create custom catalogs at scale with ShazamKit

Learn how ShazamKit can help you build custom catalogs and support exact matching of any audio source within your app â€” all on-device. Find out how you can easily generate audio signatures and build catalogs at scale through the new ShazamKit CLI. We'll also show you how you can quickly update your app to sync with large amounts of audio content like multiple seasons of a TV show or multiple episodes of a podcast, and we'll share updates to the ShazamKit API and SHMediaItems to help your apps respond precisely to key moments in audio sources using time ranges.

For more on ShazamKit, we recommend watching "Explore ShazamKit" and "Create custom audio experiences with ShazamKit" from WWDC21.
