# Bring your driver to iPad with DriverKit

Discover how you can easily connect Thunderbolt and USB accessories to iPad with DriverKit. Weâ€™ll show you how to convert your existing Mac drivers without any code changes, learn how to add real-time audio support with AudioDriverKit, and provide best practices and tips for developing drivers for iPad.

## [DriverKit][dk] Overview

- replacement for [IOKit][ik] device drivers
- new way to extend the system that is more reliable and secure, running in userspace (no longer in the kernel)
- these driver extensions, also known as <kbd>dexts</kbd>, are bundled in apps, and you can easily distribute your apps and drivers on the Mac App Store
- support for:
 - Networking 
 - Block Storage
 - Serial
 - Audio
 - USB
 - PCI
 - HID
 - SCSI controllers
 - SCSI Peripherals

## [AudioDriverKit][ak] updates

- register a real-time callback
- get a callback every time an IO operation happens
- use for signal processing

```c++
// Declare a IOOperationHandler block to set on the IOUserAudioDevice.
// The block will be called from a real time context when a i/o operation
// occurs on the IOUserAudioStream buffers for the device.
io_operation = ^kern_return_t(IOUserAudioObjectID in_device,
                IOUserAudioIOOperation in_io_operation,
                uint32_t in_io_buffer_frame_size,
                uint64_t in_sample_time,
                uint64_t in_host_time)
{
  // Add custom code to make modifications to the buffers as necessary
  if (in_io_operation == IOUserAudioIOOperationWriteEnd) {
    ...
  } else if (in_io_operation == IOUserAudioIOOperationBeginRead) {
    ...
  }
  return kIOReturnSuccess;
};
this->SetIOOperationHandler(io_operation);
```

### New entitlement (from macOS 12.1)

- if your base target is earlier, use [`com.apple.developer.driverkit.allow-any-userclient-access`][oldEnt]
- if your base target is macOS 12.1 or later, use `com.apple.developer.driverkit.family.audio`

- use [`com.apple.developer.driverkit.allow-any-userclient-access`][oldEnt] if you want any app to be able to communicate with your driver
- all `com.apple.developer.driverkit.family` entitlements are now public for development: they no longer require you to file a request
  - request for distribution [here](https://developer.apple.com/contact/request/system-extension)

## DriverKit on iPad

- no changes required for existing macOS drivers to be ported to iPad
- USBDriverKit, PCIDriverKit, AudioDriverKit support from iPadOS 16
- requires M1 iPads
- automatic discovery on iPadOS (must use [SystemExtensions][se] framework on macOS)
