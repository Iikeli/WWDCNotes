# Bring your world into augmented reality

Follow along as we demonstrate how you can use Object Capture and RealityKit to bring real-world objects into an augmented reality game. We'll show you how to capture detailed items using the Object Capture framework, add them to a RealityKit project in Xcode, apply stylized shaders and animations, and use them as part of an AR experience. We'll also share best practices when working with ARKit, RealityKit, and Object Capture.

To get the most out of this session, we recommend first watching "Dive into RealityKit 2" and "Create 3D models with Object Capture" from WWDC21.
