# Meet Swift Async Algorithms

Discover the latest open source Swift package from Apple: Swift Async Algorithms. We'll explore algorithms from this package that you can use with AsyncSequence, including zip, merge, and throttle. Follow along with us as we use these algorithms to build a great messaging app. We'll also share best practices for combining multiple AsyncSequences and using the Swift Clock type to work with values over time.

To get the most out of this session, we recommend watching "Meet AsyncSequence."
