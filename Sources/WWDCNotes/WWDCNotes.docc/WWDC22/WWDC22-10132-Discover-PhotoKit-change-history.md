# Discover PhotoKit change history

PhotoKit can help you build rich, photo-centric features. Learn how you can easily track changes to image assets with the latest APIs in PhotoKit. Weâ€™ll introduce you to the PHPhotoLibrary change history API and demonstrate how you can persist change tokens across launches to help your app recognize additions, deletions, and updates to someoneâ€™s photo library.

To learn more about Photos library integration, be sure to watch "What's new in the Photos picker" from WWDC22 and "Improve access to Photos in your app" from WWDC21.
