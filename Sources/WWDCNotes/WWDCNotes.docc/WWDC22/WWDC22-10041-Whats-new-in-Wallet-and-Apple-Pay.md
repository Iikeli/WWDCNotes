## Multi-merchant payments

Useful for things like online marketplaces, travel bookings, and ticketing services

```swift
// Create a payment request
let paymentRequest = PKPaymentRequest()
// ...

// Set total amount
paymentRequest.paymentSummaryItems = [
  PKPaymentSummaryItem(label: "Total", amount: 500)
]

// Create a multi token context for each additional merchant in the payment
let multiTokenContexts = [
  PKPaymentTokenContext(
    merchantIdentifier: "com.example.air-travel",
    externalIdentifier: "com.example.air-travel",
    merchantName: "Air Travel",
    merchantDomain: "air-travel.example.com",
    amount: 150
  ),
  PKPaymentTokenContext(
    merchantIdentifier: "com.example.hotel",
    externalIdentifier: "com.example.hotel",
    merchantName: "Hotel",
    merchantDomain: "hotel.example.com",
    amount: 300
  ),
  PKPaymentTokenContext(
    merchantIdentifier: "com.example.car-rental",
    externalIdentifier: "com.example.car-rental",
    merchantName: "Car Rental",
    merchantDomain: "car-rental.example.com",
    amount: 50
  )
]
paymentRequest.multiTokenContexts = multiTokenContexts
```

## Automatic payments (including Subscriptions)

- two types support:
  - recurring payments
  - automatic reload payments

### Recurring payments

- subscriptions, installments, or recurring billing
- fixed or variable amount charged on a regular schedule
- end on a specific date or until canceled
- trial or introductory period

```swift
// Specify the amount and billing periods
let regularBilling = PKRecurringPaymentSummaryItem(label: "Membership", amount: 20)

let trialBilling = PKRecurringPaymentSummaryItem(label: "Trial Membership", amount: 10)

let trialEndDate = Calendar.current.date(byAdding: .month, value: 1, to: Date.now)
trialBilling.endDate = trialEndDate
regularBilling.startDate = trialEndDate

// Create a recurring payment request
let recurringPaymentRequest = PKRecurringPaymentRequest(
  paymentDescription: "Book Club Membership",
  regularBilling: regularBilling,
  managementURL: URL(string: "https://www.example.com/managementURL")!
)
recurringPaymentRequest.trialBilling = trialBilling

recurringPaymentRequest.billingAgreement = """
50% off for the first month. You will be charged $20 every month after that until you cancel. \ You may cancel at any time to avoid future charges. To cancel, go to your Account and click \ Cancel Membership.
"""

recurringPaymentRequest.tokenNotificationURL = URL(
  string: "https://www.example.com/tokenNotificationURL"
)!

// Update the payment request
let paymentRequest = PKPaymentRequest()
// ...
paymentRequest.recurringPaymentRequest = recurringPaymentRequest

// Include in the summary items
let total = PKRecurringPaymentSummaryItem(label: "Book Club", amount: 10)
total.endDate = trialEndDate
paymentRequest.paymentSummaryItems = [trialBilling, regularBilling, total]
```

### Automatic reload payments

- e.g., store card balance top-ups, pre-paid accounts top-ups
- Fixed top-up amount payment
- Charged whenever account balance drops below a set threshold amount

```swift
// Specify the reload amount and threshold
let automaticReloadBilling = PKAutomaticReloadPaymentSummaryItem(
  label: "Coffee Shop Reload",
  amount: 25
)
reloadItem.thresholdAmount = 5

// Create an automatic reload payment request
let automaticReloadPaymentRequest = PKAutomaticReloadPaymentRequest(
  paymentDescription: "Coffee Shop",
  automaticReloadBilling: automaticReloadBilling,
  managementURL: URL(string: "https://www.example.com/managementURL")!
)

automaticReloadPaymentRequest.billingAgreement = """
Coffee Shop will add $25.00 to your card immediately, and will automatically reload your \
card with $25.00 whenever the balance falls below $5.00. You may cancel at any time to avoid \ future charges. To cancel, go to your Account and click Cancel Reload.
"""

automaticReloadPaymentRequest.tokenNotificationURL = URL(
  string: "https://www.example.com/tokenNotificationURL"
)!

// Update the payment request
let paymentRequest = PKPaymentRequest()
// ...
paymentRequest.automaticReloadPaymentRequest = automaticReloadPaymentRequest

// Include in the summary items
let total = PKAutomaticReloadPaymentSummaryItem(
  label: "Coffee Shop",
  amount: 25
)
total.thresholdAmount = 5
paymentRequest.paymentSummaryItems = [total]
```
