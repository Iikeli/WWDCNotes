- Most people do not need to use developer feature by default

  - iOS 16 beta releases will have the menu item always visible for the time being

## Automation flows

- Only devices without passcodes can be automatically enrolled into Developer Mode

- macOS Ventura ships with `devmodectl` that can enable Developer mode for:
  - a single device that you have already connected (Single device one-off mode)
  - all devices that you plug in (Streaming mode)

To change/enable `devmodectl` mode, run `devmodectl` in your cli:

```shell
$ devmodectl streaming
```
