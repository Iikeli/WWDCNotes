# Symbolication: Beyond the basics

Discover how you can achieve maximum performance and insightful debugging with your app. Symbolication is at the center of tools such as Instruments and LLDB to help bridge the layers between your application‚Äôs runtime and your source code. Learn how this process works and the steps you can take to gain the most insight into your app.

## What is symbolication?

Mechanism to convert/translate how our devices see our apps at runtime ‚Äî which is in terms of memory addresses and instructions ‚Äî back to how we as developers see our apps ‚Äî which is in terms of functions, names, and files.

A crash without symbols just tell us that a crash occurred, to make sense of it we need to reprocess the crash log with the build `dSYM`.

Thanks to `dSYM`, Xcode applies the concepts of symbolication, so that I can diagnose the issue with a much nicer crash log, where I can not only see all of my functions actually being called, but I can also determine the file and line number to refer back to in my code.

Alternatively, If I already have the dSYM, I can use the `atos` command to get the same information:

```cli
atos -o MyApp.dSYM/Contents/Resources/DWARF/MyApp -arch arm64 -l 0x10045c000 -i 0x16045fb70
```

## Two-steps process for symbolication

1. Going back to the file - here we convert/translate runtime memory addresses into a more stable, usable form
2. Consult debug information

## Going back to the file

Goal: translate a runtime memory address to a corresponding address in your binary on disk (a.k.a. file addresses)

### On disk address space

Your app has an address space on disk.

- assigned by the linker
- the linker groups the file into segments
- each segment has certain properties, such as a name, a size, and their assigned addresses

![][diskSpace]

- `__TEXT` segment of your binary contains all of the functions and methods you've written
- `__DATA` segment contains program-wide state such as global variables
- each of these segments gets assigned a different address such that they don't overlap
- the linker records this information at the very beginning of your executables as part of the Mach-O header

### Mach-O

Mach-O is the format used for all executable binaries and libraries, and the system knows that it needs to read this header to run your apps.

- the Mach-O header contains a number of load commands that hold the segment properties
- the system uses these load commands to load the segments into memory
- if your apps are Universal 2, then the app will have one header and a set of segments for each architecture

We can inspect these load commands by using `otool -l` in the terminal, which prints the load commands for a specified file

### ASLR slide

Before the kernel actually loads the segments, it initializes a random value known as the ASLR slide

- this is to randomize the addresses values, it's a safety feature
- all runtime addresses will be shifted by this ASLR slide
- the difference between a runtime address and the linker address is the ASLR slide
- we can always go back to the file address space once we know the ASLR slide

### Crash example

This is the crash report that we will use in this session:

```cli
Thread 0 Crashed:: Dispatch queue: com.apple.main-thread

Binary Images: 
  0x10045c000 - 0x10045ffff +MyApp <C061EE83-B61D-3352-8EE5-655491DB1D16> /Users/USER/MyApp
```

### Computing the ASLR slide

The ASLR slide equation requires two addresses: 

1. the load address
2. the linker address

```
ASLR slide + linker address = load address
```

We can get the load address by looking at the mach-o load commands via `otool`.

To know the runtime address, the system queries your app either at the point of a crash, or as its being profiled by Instruments for its runtime address space.

> You can also see the load addresses interactively with the `vmmap` tool, which enumerates the active memory regions in your program

We can see the load address from the crashlog (`0x10045c000`, in the `Binary images` section):

```cli
0x10045c000 - 0x10045ffff +MyApp <C061EE83-B61D-3352-8EE5-655491DB1D16>
```

We can see the linker address from `otool` (`0x0000000100000000` or `0x100000000`):

```cli
$ otool -l MyApp | grep LC_SEGMENT -A8 

     cmd LC_SEGMENT_64      # segment load command
 cmdsize 712
 segname __TEXT             # name and 
  vmaddr 0x0000000100000000 # address
  vmsize 0x0000000000004000 # range
 fileoff 0 
filesize 16384 
 maxprot 0x00000005 
initprot 0x00000005 
```

Subtracting these two yields (`0x10045c000 - 0x100000000`) an ASLR slide value of `0x45c000`

- This means that every address in my program's runtime `__TEXT` segment is `0x45c000` bytes away from the linker `__TEXT` segment address

### Back to the file address space

Now that we have the ASLR slide value, we can see what a backtrace address from the crash log corresponds to in the file:

```cli
Thread 0 Crashed:: Dispatch queue: com.apple.main-thread 
0 MyApp              0x000000010045fb70 0x10045c000 + 15216
```

```cli
ASLR slide = 0x45c000 
Backtrace address = 0x000000010045fb70
0x10045fb70 - 0x45c000 = 0x100003b70 
``` 

`0x100003b70` is the address on disk 

Since this address is now part of the on-disk address space, I can inspect my app to see what resides there.

We can use `otool` too see where the crash occurred:

```cli
otool -tV MyApp -arch arm64
```

This will print the disassembly where the crask occurred:

```cli
// ASLR slide = 0x45c000
// 0x10045fb70 - 0x45c000 = 0x100003B70 

0000000100003b6c      ret
0000000100003670      brk #0x1 
```

- `brk` signals an exception or a problem in the app

Other ways to calculate ASLR slide:

- `atos` will read the load commands for the file segment address indicated by the `-o` flag, and we tell it about the load address with the `-l` flag

- `vmmap` can also tell us about the load addresses of a running app (run this before it crashes)

```cli
vmmap MyApp | grep __TEXT
```

### Debug information

- created during build
- either embedded directly into your app binaries, or stored as a separate file, such as a `.dSYM`

- There are different categories/types of debug info
- each offers a different level of detail for a given file address:

|    | Function addresses | Function names | File and line numbers | Optimizations |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Function starts | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå |
| Nlist symbol table | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | ‚ùå |
| DWARF | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |

- Since DWARF offers the most detail, we really want to strive to have this type of debug info whenever possible

#### Function starts

- offers the least source code detail
- only tells us about the first address ‚Äî or the literal start ‚Äî of our functions
- this would tell us that a function begins and exists at a certain address. However, it doesn't tell us which functions begin at those addresses, only that they exist

![][functionStarts]

The function starts debug info does this by encoding the list of addresses in your app's `__LINKEDIT` segment.

Since this is embedded directly in your app, the Mach-O header also has a load command to inform us where we can find it, which is `LC_FUNCTION_STARTS`.

We can obtain the function starts with the `symbols` command and the `-onlyFuncStartsData` flag

```
symbols -onlyFuncStartsData -arch arm64 MyApp
```

```
0x0000000100003a68 (    0x3c4) TEXT _text 
  0x0000000100003a68 (   0x10c) (null) [FUNC, FunctionStarts]
  0x0000000100003674 (    0x3c) (null) [FUNC, FunctionStarts] 
  0x0000000100003bb0 (   0x114) (null) [FUNC, FunctionStarts] 
  0x0000000100003cc4 (    0x40) (null) [FUNC, FunctionStarts] 
  0x0000000100003d04 (    0x98) (null) [FUNC, FunctionStarts] 
  0x0000000100003d9c (    0x8c) (null) [FUNC, FunctionStarts] 
  0x0000000100003e28 (     0x4) (null) [FUNC, FunctionStarts] 
```

Here we get back a list of addresses and `null` placeholders

These placeholders would ideally have function and method names instead of null, but the function starts data doesn't provide names.

However, it does allow for a slight update to the crash log.

We can now view the file addresses as offsets from a function.

For example: 

```cli
Thread 0 Crashed:: Dispatch queue: com.apple.main-thread 
0 MyApp              0x000000010045fb70 0x10045c000 + 15216
```

1. first we go back to the file by subtracting the ASLR slide value:

```cli
Thread 0 Crashed:: Dispatch queue: com.apple.main-thread 
0 MyApp              0x100003b70 0x100003a68 + 264
```

2. Then we find the function starts value that could contain the file address:

```
0x0000000100003a68 (    0x3c4) TEXT _text 
  0x0000000100003a68 (   0x10c) (null) [FUNC, FunctionStarts] // üëàüèª
  0x0000000100003674 (    0x3c) (null) [FUNC, FunctionStarts] 
  ...
```

In this case, only the first value could contain the address because all of the other values are larger than the address.

3. Finally we can claim that our file address is actually 264 bytes into this function

This is primarily useful for debuggers, since they can understand the details of how this function was set up and which registers were modified.

This is all we get from Function starts.

#### Nlist symbol table

- builds on the idea of function starts
- encode a list of information in the `__LINKEDIT` segment (described by `LC_SYMTAB`)
- more than just encoding addresses, they encode `nlist_62` C structs

```c
struct nlist_64 {
  union {
    uint32_t  n_strx;
  } n_un;
  uint8_t n_type; // Determines values and properties
  uint8_t n_sect;
  uint16_t n_desc;
  uint64_t n_value; 
};
```

There are two primary `n_type`s:

1. direct symbols
2. indirect symbols

The way we distinguish them is via `n_type` value:

- direct symbols: 
  - `000001110` - second, third, and fourth least significant bits set
  - this bit pattern is also known as `N_SECT` (`0xe`)

- indirect symbols:
  - `000000001` - only the least significant bit is set
  - this bit pattern is also known as `N_EXT` (`0x01`)

### Direct symbols

- functions and methods defined in your apps and frameworks
- have a name and address in the `nlist_64` struct

We can list all direct symbols via `nm` (`nm` stands for name - it's the display symbol name list tool):

```cli
nm -arch arm64 --defined-only --numeric-sort MyApp
```

Output:

```cli
0000000100000000 T __mh_execute_header 0000000100003a68 T _main 
0000000100003674 t ___swift_instantiateConcreteTypeFromMangledName
0000000100003bb0 t _$s12MyApp13numberChoicesSaySiGyF 
0000000100003cc4 t _$sS2iSzsWl
0000000100003d04 t _$ss12_ArrayBufferV20_consumeAndCreateNew14bufferIsUnique15minimumCapacity
0000000100003d9c t _$ss22_ContiguousArrayBufferV19_uninitializedCount15minimumCapacityAByxGSi
0000000100003e28 t __swift_stdlib_malloc_size 
0000000100003ef0 s ___swift_reflection_version 
```

- `nm` walked through the defined symbols of the app program and listed them in address order
- the names stored in the symbol tables are mangled names
- these mangled names help the compiler and linker to uniquely identify a function, but they aren't easy to understand unless they're demangled 

For a better output, we can pass `nm` output to `swift-demangle`:

```cli
nm -arch arm64 ‚Äîdefined-only --numeric-sort MyApp | xcrun swift-demangle
```

Output:

```cli
0000000100000000 T __mh_execute_header
0000000100003a68 T _main
0000000100003674 t ___swift_instantiateConcreteTypeFromMangledName
0000000100003bb0 t MyApp.numberChoices() -> [Swift.Int]
0000000100003cc4 t lazy protocol witness table accessor for type Swift.Int and conformance Swift
0000000100003d04 t t generic specialization <Swift.Int> of Swift._ArrayBuffer._consumeAndCreateNew.Bool) -> Swift._ArrayBuffer<A> 
```

`symbols` tool also has an option to show Nlist data, it demangles names automatically:

```cli
symbols -arch arm64 -onlyNListData MyApp
```

```cli
0x0000000100003a68 (0x3c4) _TEXT __text 
  0x0000000100003a68 (  0x10c) main [FUNC, EXT, NameNList, MangledNameNList, Merged, List, FunctionStarts]
  0x0000000100003b74 (   0x3c) __swift_instantiateConcreteTypeFromMangledName [FUNC, PEXT, NameNList, MangledNameNList 
  0x0000000100003bb0 (  0x114) numberChoices () [FUNC, PEXT, NameNList, MangledNameNList, Merged, NList, FunctionStarts 
  0x0000000100003cc4 (   0x40) lazy protocol witness table accessor for type Int and conformance Int [FUNC, PEXT, Name 
  0x0000000100003d04 (   0x98) specialized _ArrayBuffer._consumeAndCreateNew(bufferIsUnique:minimumCapacity:growForApp
  0x0000000100003d9c (   0x8c) specialized _ContiguousArrayBuffer.init(_uninitializedCount:minimumCapacity:)[FUNC,PE 
  0x0000000100003e28 (    0x4) _swift_stdlib_malloc_size [FUNC, NameNList, MangledNameNList, Merged, NList, FunctionSt 
```

Going back to our crashlog:

```cli
Thread 0 Crashed:: Dispatch queue: com.apple.main-thread 
0 MyApp              0x100003b70 0x10003a68 + 264
```

Here we can observe that our offset expression (`0x10003a68 + 264`) that we got from the function starts data also matches an entry from the direct symbols. That entry has a name:

```cli
0x0000000100003a68 (  0x10c) main
```

Putting these two together, we can now say that our crash happened at 264 bytes into `main`:

```cli
Thread 0 Crashed:: Dispatch queue: com.apple.main-thread 
0 MyApp              0x100003b70 main + 264
```

This still doesn't tell us a lot, because direct symbols have some limitations such as missing some functions names.

One reason for this is that the symbol table only has direct symbol entries for functions that are involved in linking:

- these are functions that you use across modules or functions that you export from your frameworks
- this makes it useful for identifying API boundaries
- it has the necessary data to power dynamic loading with functions such as `dlsym()` and `dladdr()`

Direct symbols gaps in information:

- local, static functions are not represented
  - can omit implementation functions

- stripped in release configurations
  - primary app executables left practically empty
  - helps reduce the size of our app
  - frameworks left with only exported functions

![][stripXcode]

Xcode has various build settings around stripping symbols such as:

- `Strip Linked Product` - if enabled, then the binary is stripped according to Strip Style
- `Strip Style` - three options:
  - All Symbols - Most invasive; preserve essentials
  - Non Global - Remove locally shared functions
  - Debugging Symbols - Remove debug list entry, keep direct symbols 

### Indirect symbols

These are functions and methods that you're using from other frameworks or libraries, such as `print()`

You can see them via `nm`:

```cli
nm -m ‚Äîarch arm64 --undefined-only --numeric-sort MyApp
```

> the `m` flag asks `nm` to print from which frameworks the symbols come from

```cli
(undefined) external Swift._allocateUninitializedArray<A>(Builtin.Word) -> ([A], Builtin.RawPointer) (from libswiftCore)
(undefined) external Swift.print(_: 
Any..., separator: Swift.String, terminator: Swift. String) -> () (from libswiftCore)
(undefined) external type metadata for Any (from libswiftCore) 
```

### Function starts, nlist recap

Function starts are a list of addresses (they lack names, but do allow us to determine offsets)

NList symbols tables:

- add names to addresses
- direct and indirect symbols
- reserved for functions involved in linking
- strip build settings influence which direct symbols are available.

Both are embedded in `__LINKEDIT` (in debug mode)

What we haven't seen yet is the richer levels of detail, such as file names and line numbers. This is provided to us by DWARF.

### DWARF

- DWARF strives to describe everything
- DWARD adds relationships to nlist symbols data
- primarily found in dSYM bundles

When we're analyzing DWARF, we're primarily referring to a dSYM bundle.

In addition to other metadata such as plists, the dSYM bundle contains a binary with DWARF.

#### DWARF binary

![][dwarfBinary]

The DWARF specification mentions three streams of data within the segment:

1. `debug_info` contains the raw data
2. `debug_abbrev` assigns structure to the data
3. `debug_line` contains the file names and line numbers

DWARF also defines two vocabulary types:

- the compile unit
  - a single source file that went into building the product
  - contains assigned attributes and properties (name of the file, the SDKs, the portion of the `__TEXT` segment its functions occupy, and much more)

- the subprogram
  - represents a defined function
  - not limited to exported or shared functions
  - name and `__TEXT` segment range
  - defined in compile units
    - DWARD represents this with a tree

We can observe this in detail with the `dwarfdump` command:

```cli
dwarfdump -v -debug-info -arch arm64 MyApp.dSYM
```

```cli
DW_TAG_compile_unit [154] *
  DW_AT_producer [DW_FORM_strp]    (.debug_str[0x000b656e] = "Apple Swift version 5.5 (swiftlang-1300.0.16.7 clang-1300.0.18.1)")
  DW_AT_language [DW_FORM_data2]   (DW_ LANG Swift)
  DW_AT_name [DW_FORM_strp] ( .debug_str[0x000b65b0] = '/Users/USER/Projects/MyApp/main.swift")
  DW_AT_stmt_list [DW_FORM_sec_offset] (0x0000a7be)
  DW_AT_comp_dir [DW_FORM_strp] debug_st[0x000b65f2] = "/Users/USER/Projects/MyApp")
  DW_AT_APPLE_optimized [DW_FORM_flag_present] (true)
  DW_AT_APPLE_major_runtime_vers [DW_FORM_data1] (0x05)
  DW_AT_low_pc [DW_FORM_addr] (0x0000000100003a68) 
  DW_AT_high_pc [DW_FORM_data4] (0x000003c0) 
```

`dwarfdump` helpfully combines the `debug_ info` and `debug _abbrev` contents to show you the structure and content of the data in your dSYMs.

File names and line numbers come from the `debug_line` stream

- this stream defines a line table program where the individual file addresses can be mapped back to an exact line of code
- generates a list of source code details which we can search to find the file and line

Given a crash log and a DWARF, we can map back to the specific line of code where the crash has happened via `atos`:

```
atos -o MyApp.dSYM/Contents/Resources/DWARF/MyApp -arch arm64 ‚Äîl 0x10045c000 0x10045fb70
```

Output:

```
main (in MyApp) (main.swift:36)
```

DWARF also takes care of inline functions

#### DWARF recap

- function and file relationships 
- inlined functions impact the quality of symbolication (DWARF can take care of this)
- can be found in dSYMs and static libraries (prefer dSYM, as you can easily transfer them to others and have built-in support from several tools)

## Tools and tips

- in Xcode build settings, make sure that the `Debug Information Format` is set to `DWARF with dSYM File` for your Release mode
- you can download your dSYMs through App Store Connect

If you want to check that a certain dSYM is already on your device, you can use the `mdfind` command

```
mdfind "com_apple_xcode_dsyms_uuids == C061EE83-B61D-3352-8EE5-655491DB1D16" /User/USER/Documents/MyApp.dSYM
```

> the alphanumeric string here is your binary's UUID, which is a unique identifier defined in a load command

You can see the UUID for your dSYMs with `symbols -uuid`:

```
symbols -uuid MyApp.dSYM
``` 

The app's UUID is in the `Binary Images` list section of crash reports and you can also see it with the `symbols` command:

```cli
symbols -uuid MyApp
```

A toolchain could generate invalid DWARF. You can check this with:

```
dwarfdump ‚Äîverify MyApp.dSYM
```

You can use `symbols` to check the types of debug information your app has available:

```
symbols -arch arm64 MyApp
```

Output:

```cli

### Verify entitlements

If you're certain that you have dSYMs available but still aren't getting names for your functions in Instruments traces, check your entitlements and code signing:

```cli
codesign --display -v  --entitlements :- MyApp.app
```

```xml
Format=app bundle with Mach-O universal (√ó86_64 arm64) 
CodeDirectory v=20500 size=909 flags=0x10000 (runtime) hashes=17+7 location=embedded 
Signature size=4810                     # üëàüèª
Signed Time=May 15, 2021 at 4:46:02 PM  # üëàüèª
Info.plist entries=23                   # üëàüèª

Sealed Resources version=2 rules=13 files=4
Internal requirements count=1 size=200 
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "https://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version= "1.0">
  <dict>
    <key>com.apple.security.app-sandbox</key>
    <true/> 
    <key>com.apple-security.get-task-allow</key> # üëàüèª
    <true/>                                      # üëàüèª
    ...
```


You should also verify that locally built apps for development have the `get-task-allow` entitlement.

This entitlement grants permissions to tools such as Instruments to symbolicate your app.

If you don't have the `get-task-allow` entitlement enabled, you should check your `Code Signing Inject Base Entitlements` build setting and make sure that it's enabled as you're developing.

### DWARF size limits

- limited to 4GB
- consider splitting the project into separate components/modules so that each one has its own smaller dSYM
