# Create custom audio experiences with ShazamKit

Bring custom audio matching to your app with ShazamKit. Discover how you can use Shazam's exact audio matching to recognize audio against any source when you use custom catalogs on device.

Download our starter project and code along with the presenter as we guide you through the process of matching audio against a custom catalog. Weâ€™ll also explore how easy it is to connect content across devices by building an interactive iOS app that can synchronize perfectly with video being streamed from a TV.
