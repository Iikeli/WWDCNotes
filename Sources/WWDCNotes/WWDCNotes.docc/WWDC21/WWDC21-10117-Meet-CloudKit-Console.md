# Meet CloudKit Console

Discover how CloudKit Console can help you better interact with your containers. Weâ€™ll show you how to put the database app to work and define, modify, and deploy schema changes with confidence. Youâ€™ll learn how to craft queries in the query builder and filter your records with ease. And weâ€™ll explore how to use telemetry and log data to gain new insights into your app behavior over time.

To get the most out of this session, we recommend being familiar with CloudKit and its development and production environments, as well as a basic understanding of record and data types.
