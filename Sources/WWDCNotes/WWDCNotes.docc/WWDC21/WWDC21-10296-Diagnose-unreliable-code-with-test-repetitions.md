# Diagnose unreliable code with test repetitions

Test repetitions can help you debug even the most unreliable code. Discover how you can use the maximum repetitions, until failure, and retry on failure testing modes within test plans, Xcode, and xcodebuild to track down bugs and crashers and make your app more stable for everyone.

To get the most out of this session, we recommend being familiar with XCTest and managing tests through test plans. For more information, check out ‚ÄúTesting in Xcode‚Äù from WWDC19.
