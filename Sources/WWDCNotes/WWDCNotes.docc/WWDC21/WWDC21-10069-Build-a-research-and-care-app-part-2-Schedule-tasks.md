# Build a research and care app, part 2: Schedule tasks

Learn how ResearchKit and CareKit can work together to take the tedium out of paper surveys. Continue coding along with us and explore how you can make it easier than ever to schedule surveys for your study participants. You‚Äôll also learn advanced techniques for crafting evolving regiments in CareKit and see how ResearchKit‚Äôs active tasks can help capture important measurements out of clinic.

This is the second session in a three-part Code-Along series. To get the most out of this session, we recommend first watching ‚ÄúBuild a research and care app, part 1.‚Äù And for more background on these frameworks, watch "ResearchKit and CareKit Reimagined‚Äù from WWDC19.
