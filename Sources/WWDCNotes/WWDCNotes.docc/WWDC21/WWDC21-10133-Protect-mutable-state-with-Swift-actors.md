# Protect mutable state with Swift actors

Data races occur when two separate threads concurrently access the same mutable state. They are trivial to construct, but are notoriously hard to debug.

Discover how you can stop these data races in their tracks with Swift actors, which help synchronize access to data in your code. Discover how actors work and how to share values between them. Learn about how actor isolation affects protocol conformances. And finally, meet the main actor, a new way of ensuring that your code always runs on the main thread when needed.
