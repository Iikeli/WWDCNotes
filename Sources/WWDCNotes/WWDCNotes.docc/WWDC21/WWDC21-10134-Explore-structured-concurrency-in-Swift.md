# Explore structured concurrency in Swift

When you have code that needs to run at the same time as other code, it‚Äôs important to choose the right tool for the job. We'll take you through the different kinds of concurrent tasks you can create in Swift, show you how to create groups of tasks, and find out how to cancel tasks in progress. We'll also provide guidance on when you may want to use unstructured tasks.

To get the most out of this session, we first recommend watching ‚ÄúMeet async/await in Swift.‚Äù
