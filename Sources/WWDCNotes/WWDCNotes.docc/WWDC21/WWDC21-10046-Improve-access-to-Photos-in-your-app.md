# Improve access to Photos in your app

PHPicker is the simplest and most secure way to integrate the Photos library into your app â€” and itâ€™s getting even better. Learn how to handle ordered selection of images in your app, as well as pre-selecting assets any time the picker is shown. And for apps that need to integrate more deeply with PhotoKit, discover how you can use PHCloudIdentifier to sync photo project content across devices, helping people easily transition their image work between iPhone, iPad, and Mac.

Weâ€™ll also take you through the latest updates to the Limited Photos Library. Find out how your app can help people easily extend the initial set of images theyâ€™ve authorized â€” including bringing up the selection UI at any time and recognizing when someone makes new or updated selections. Lastly, explore how you can create or access existing photo albums.
