# Send communication and Time Sensitive notifications

Learn more about the evolution of notifications on Apple platforms. Weâ€™ll explore how you can help people manage notifications within your app, including how you can craft meaningful moments with interruption levels and Time Sensitive notifications. And weâ€™ll introduce you to communication notifications, providing a richer experience for calls and messages in your app through SiriKit.

To get the most out of this session, we recommend having experience creating local and remote notifications, as well as some familiarity with SiriKit intents.
