# SwiftUI on the Mac: The finishing touches

Join us for part two of our Code-Along series as we use SwiftUI to build a Mac app from start to finish. The journey continues as we explore how our sample gardening app can adapt to a personâ€™s preferences and specific workflows. Learn how SwiftUI apps can automatically react to system settings, and discover how you can use that information to add more personality to an app. Weâ€™ll show you how you can give people the flexibility to customize an app through Settings, and explore how to use different workflows for manipulating someoneâ€™s data (like drag and drop). To finish, weâ€™ll show you how you can move data to and from an app, incorporating features like Continuity Camera to provide a simple workflow for importing images.
