# Bring Recurring Leaderboards to your game

Recurring leaderboards are a great way to encourage players to keep coming back to your game. Code along with us as we take you through how to set up a recurring leaderboard, both within App Store Connect and in your game itself.

For a refresher on the differences between recurring and classic leaderboards before beginning this code-along, we recommend watching the recurring leaderboards section of "Tap into Game Center: Leaderboards, Achievements, and Multiplayer" from WWDC20.
