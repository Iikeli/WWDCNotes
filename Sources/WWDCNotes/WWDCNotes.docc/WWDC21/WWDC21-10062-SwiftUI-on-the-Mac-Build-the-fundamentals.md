# SwiftUI on the Mac: Build the fundamentals

Code along with us as we use SwiftUI to build a Mac app from start to finish. Discover four principles all great Mac apps have in common, and learn how to apply those principles in practice using SwiftUI. Weâ€™ll show you how to create a powerful, flexible sidebar experience and transform lists to tables within a detail view, then discuss best best practices for data organization. Next, weâ€™ll explore the simple .searchable modifier and find out how to add support for the toolbar and search. And to close out part one, weâ€™ll learn how to build a great multiple-window experience and provide menu bar support.

This is the first session in a two-part Code-Along series. To get the most out of this series, we recommend that you have some basic familiarity with SwiftUI. For more background, watch "Introduction to SwiftUI" from WWDC20.
