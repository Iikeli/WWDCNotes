# Practice audio haptic design

Discover how you can deliver rich app experiences that include animation, sound, and haptics on iPhone. Learn key concepts for designing multimodal experiences within the Core Haptics framework. We‚Äôll take you through our sample HapticRicochet app ‚Äî where haptic and sound feedback is designed in harmony with key interactive moments ‚Äî and show you how to create magical and delightful experiences.

To get the most out of this session, we recommend first watching ‚ÄúExpanding the Sensory Experience with Core Haptics‚Äù from WWDC19, and checking out the HapticBounce sample project (which requires Xcode, iPhone 8 or newer, and a basic knowledge of Swift). Familiarity with Core Haptics is helpful, but not required.
