# Meet the Location Button

Meet CLLocationButton: a secure interface element that provides an easy, low-friction way to grant your app location access only when and where it is needed. Learn how you can add CLLocationButton to new or existing code, how to customize it within interface legibility guidelines, how to recognize and address customization failures, and how it interacts with iOSâ€™s traditional prompt-based Location Services authorization.

To get the most out of this session, we recommend basic familiarity with the Core Location API.
