# Meet DocC documentation in Xcode

Discover how you can use DocC to build and share documentation for Swift packages and frameworks. Weâ€™ll show you how to begin generating documentation from your own code â€” or from third-party code you depend upon â€” and write and format it using Markdown. And weâ€™ll also take you through the export process, helping you generate DocC archives to share with the public.
