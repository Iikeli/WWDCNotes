# What's new in CloudKit

CloudKit provides a secure, convenient, and reliable cloud database for your apps â€” and itâ€™s only getting better. Discover how you can unravel your threads with support for async/await and convenience API additions. Weâ€™ll also show you how to encourage collaboration between people using your app through sharing entire record zones of data, and explore how to adopt CloudKit features like encrypted values and help protect sensitive data within your app.

To get the most out of this session, we recommend being familiar with CloudKit and its operations on containers, as well as a basic understanding of record and data types.
