# Localize your SwiftUI app

Learn how to localize your SwiftUI app and make it available to a global audience. Explore how you can localize strings in SwiftUI, including those with styles and formatting. We'll demonstrate how you can save time by having SwiftUI automatically handle tasks such as layout and keyboard shortcuts, and take you through the localization workflow in Xcode 13.
