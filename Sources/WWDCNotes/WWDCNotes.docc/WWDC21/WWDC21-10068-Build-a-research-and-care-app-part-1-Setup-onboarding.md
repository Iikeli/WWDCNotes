# Build a research and care app, part 1: Setup onboarding

Learn how ResearchKit and CareKit can work together to take the tedium out of paper surveys. Code along with us and build a working care pilot app. Explore best practices for onboarding and consent with ResearchKit, and find out how your app can require participants to sign consent documents by leveraging CareKit‚Äôs store and UI components.

This is the first session in a three-part Code-Along series. To get the most out of this series, we recommend that you have some basic familiarity with both ResearchKit and CareKit. For more background, watch "ResearchKit and CareKit Reimagined‚Äù from WWDC19.
