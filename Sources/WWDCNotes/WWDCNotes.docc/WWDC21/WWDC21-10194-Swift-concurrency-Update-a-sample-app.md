# Swift concurrency: Update a sample app

Discover Swift concurrency in action: Follow along as we update an existing sample app. Get real-world experience with async/await, actors, and continuations. We‚Äôll also explore techniques for migrating existing code to Swift concurrency over time.

To get the most out of this code-along, we recommend first watching ‚ÄúMeet async/await in Swift‚Äù and ‚ÄúProtect mutable state with Swift actors‚Äù from WWDC21.

Note: To create an async task in Xcode 13 beta 3 and later, use the Task initializer instead.
