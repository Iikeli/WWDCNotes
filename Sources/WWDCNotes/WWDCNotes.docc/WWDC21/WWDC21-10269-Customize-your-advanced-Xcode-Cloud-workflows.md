# Customize your advanced Xcode Cloud workflows

Xcode Cloud integrates with Apple Developer tools and services, all major source control management services, and even social collaboration tools like Slack. If your development process relies on additional tools and external services, however, you can fine-tune your workflows and the behavior of your build.

Learn how you can pass information to your build using environment variables and run additional commands inside your actions using custom build scripts. Find out how to add additional repositories where you and your team might share work. And discover how you can integrate Xcode Cloud with external services using webhooks.

To get the most out of this session, we recommend first watching ‚ÄúMeet Xcode Cloud‚Äù and ‚ÄúExplore Xcode Cloud workflows‚Äù from WWDC21.
