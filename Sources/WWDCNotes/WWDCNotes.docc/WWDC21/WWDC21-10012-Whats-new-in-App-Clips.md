# What's new in App Clips

Discover how App Clips can elevate quick and focused experiences for specific tasks, the moment your customer needs them. We‚Äôll take you through some of the latest improvements to App Clips, including launching an experience directly from an app, testing your App Clip locally, and creating App Clip Codes to make it easy to access your experience in the real world. We‚Äôll also share some great examples of App Clips from our developer community that provide innovative ways to interact with people and beautiful designs.

To get the most of this session, we recommend first watching ‚ÄúExplore App Clips‚Äù and ‚ÄúConfigure and link your App Clips‚Äù from WWDC20.
