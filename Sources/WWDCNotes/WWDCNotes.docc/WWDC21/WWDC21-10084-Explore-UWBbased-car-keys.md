# Explore UWB-based car keys

Discover how to create digital car keys that support Ultra Wideband (UWB), allowing people to unlock and start their car while leaving iPhone in their bag or pocket or Apple Watch on their wrist. Weâ€™ll show you how to integrate UWB, add proximity actions and distance unlock features, and help people personalize their vehicle settings by identifying which key someone uses on the driver-side door.
