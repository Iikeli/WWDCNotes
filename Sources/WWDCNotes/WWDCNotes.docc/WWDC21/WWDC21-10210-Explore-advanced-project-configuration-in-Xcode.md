# Explore advanced project configuration in Xcode

Working with more complex Xcode projects? Youâ€™ve come to the right place. Discover how you can configure your project to build for multiple Apple platforms, filter content per-platform, create custom build rules and file dependencies, and more. Weâ€™ll take you through multi-platform framework targets, detail how to optimize your project and scheme configuration, and show you how to make effective use of configuration settings files. 

Weâ€™ll explore configuring schemes for parallel builds and implicit dependencies, script phases, custom build rules, setting up input and output file dependencies, build phase file lists, and deduplicating work via aggregate targets. Lastly, find out more about the build settings editor, how levels work, and configuration settings file syntax.
