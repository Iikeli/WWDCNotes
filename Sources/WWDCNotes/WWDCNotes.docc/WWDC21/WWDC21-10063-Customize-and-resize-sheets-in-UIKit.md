# Customize and resize sheets in UIKit

Discover how you can create a layered and customized sheet experience in UIKit. Weâ€™ll explore how you can build a non-modal experience in your app to allow interaction with content both in a sheet and behind the sheet at the same time. Weâ€™ll also take you through sheet size customization, revealing or hiding grabber controls, and adapting between popovers and customized sheets in your app.
