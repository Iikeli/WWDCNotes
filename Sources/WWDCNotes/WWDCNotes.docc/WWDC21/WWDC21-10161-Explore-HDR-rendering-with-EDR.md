# Explore HDR rendering with EDR

EDR is Appleâ€™s High Dynamic Range representation and rendering pipeline. Explore how you can render HDR content using EDR in your app and unleash the dynamic range capabilities of your HDR display including Appleâ€™s internal displays and Pro Display XDR.

Weâ€™ll show you how game and pro app developers can take advantage of the native EDR APIs on macOS for even more control, and provide best practices for deciding when HDR is appropriate, applying tone-mapping, and delivering HDR content.
