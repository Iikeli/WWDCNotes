# Add rich graphics to your SwiftUI app

Learn how you can bring your graphics to life with SwiftUI. Weâ€™ll begin by working with safe areas, including the keyboard safe area, and learn how to design beautiful, edge-to-edge graphics that wonâ€™t underlap the on-screen keyboard. Weâ€™ll also explore the materials and vibrancy you can use in SwiftUI to create easily customizable backgrounds and controls, and go over graphics APIs like drawingGroup and the all new canvas. With these tools, itâ€™s simpler than ever to design fully interactive and interruptible animations and graphics in SwiftUI.
