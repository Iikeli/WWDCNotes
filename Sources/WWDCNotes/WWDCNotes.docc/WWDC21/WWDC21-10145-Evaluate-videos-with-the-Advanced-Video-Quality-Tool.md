# Evaluate videos with the Advanced Video Quality Tool

Learn how the Advanced Video Quality Tool (AVQT) can help you accurately assess the perceptual quality of your compressed video files. Utilizing the AVFoundation framework, AVQT supports a wide range of video formats, codecs, resolutions and frame-rates in both the SDR and HDR domains, which results in easy and efficient workflows â€” for example, no requirement to decode to a raw pixel format.

AVQT uses Metal to achieve high processing speeds by offloading heavy pixel-level computation to the GPU, typically analyzing videos in excess of real-time video frame rates. With incredible ease of use and computational efficiency, AVQT can help you eliminate low-quality videos from your video catalog before they might otherwise reach people in your app.
