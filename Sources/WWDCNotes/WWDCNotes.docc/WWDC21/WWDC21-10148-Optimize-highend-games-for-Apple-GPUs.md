# Optimize high-end games for Apple GPUs

Optimize your high-end games for Apple GPUs: We‚Äôll show you how you can use our rendering and debugging tools to eliminate performance issues and make your games great on Apple platforms. Learn from our experiences working with developers at Larian Studios and 4A Games as we help them optimize their games for Apple GPUs.

We‚Äôll explore various techniques for improving your game‚Äôs performance, including optimizing shaders, reducing memory bandwidth utilization, and increasing the overlap of your GPU workloads. We‚Äôll also dive into the new GPU Timeline profiling tool in Xcode 13 to identify possible performance bottlenecks in ‚ÄúDivinity: Original Sin 2‚Äù when running on iPad.

For this session, you should be familiar with the tile-based deferred rendering architecture in Apple GPUs, and have a working knowledge of Xcode and the Metal API.

Check out ‚ÄúDiscover Metal debugging, profiling, and asset creation tools‚Äù or the WWDC20 session ‚ÄúOptimize Metal apps and games with GPU counters‚Äù to learn more about using our tools to profile graphics workloads.
