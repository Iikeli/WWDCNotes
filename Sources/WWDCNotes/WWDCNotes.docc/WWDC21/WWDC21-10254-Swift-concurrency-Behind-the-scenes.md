# Swift concurrency: Behind the scenes

Dive into the details of Swift concurrency and discover how Swift provides greater safety from data races and thread explosion while simultaneously improving performance. We’ll explore how Swift tasks differ from Grand Central Dispatch, how the new cooperative threading model works, and how to ensure the best performance for your apps.

To get the most out of this session, we recommend first watching “Meet async/await in Swift,” “Explore structured concurrency in Swift,” and “Protect mutable state with Swift actors.”
