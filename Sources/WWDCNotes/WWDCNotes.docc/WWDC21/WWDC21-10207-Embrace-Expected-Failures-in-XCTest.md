# Embrace Expected Failures in XCTest

Testing is a crucial part of building a great app: Great tests can help you track down important issues before release, improve your workflow, and provide a quality experience upon release. For issues that canâ€™t be immediately resolved, however, XCTest can help provide better context around those problems with XCTExpectFailure. Learn how this API works, its strict behavior, and how to improve the signal-to-noise ratio in your tests to identify new issues more efficiently.
