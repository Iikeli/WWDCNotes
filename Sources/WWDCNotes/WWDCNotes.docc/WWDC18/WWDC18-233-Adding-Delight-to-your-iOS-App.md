This topic is split in six topics:

- External Display Support
- Layout-Driven UI
- Laser-Fast Launches
- Smooth Scrolling
- Continuing with Continuity
- Debugging Like a Pro

## External Display Support

- As we know we screen mirroring on the apple tv we replicate our screen to the tv display.

- It would be much nicer to have custom screens for example this in game:  
![][car2ndScreenImage]

- When adding external display support, you should keep in mind that what is displayed on the phone is personal/private, while what is in the screen is public.
- Also the external display is not interactive, only the phone one is.

- When designing for external display, there are three topics to focus on:
  - Connectivity
    - How do you know that there's a screen connected? 
      - UIScreen.screens is an array of screens: if > 1 you have at least one external 
      - We also get notifications when a new screen get connected/disconnected via:

```swift
UIScreen.didConnectNotification
UIScreen.didDisconnectNotification
```

- 
  - 
    - 
      - What to do on connected and disconnected?
      - Connected:

```swift
if let externalScreen = UIScreen.screens.last {
  externalWindow = UIWindow()
  externalWindow.screen = externalScreen
  configureExternalWindow(externalWindow)
  externalWindow.isHidden = false
} 
```
- 
  - 
    - 
      - Disconnected:

```swift
externalWindow.isHidden = true
externalWindow = nil
```

- 
  - Behavior
    - Update your app behavior (lots of if-else whether we have an external display or not)

- 
  - Transitions
    - Make sure that the transitions between one screen to two and viceversa is graceful

## Layout-Driven UI

- Find and track state that affects UI
- Dirty layout when state changes with `setNeedsLayout()`
- Update UI with state in `layoutSubviews()`

```swift
class MyView: UIView { 
  // ... 
  let coolView = CoolView()
  var feelingCool = true { 
    didSet { 
      setNeedsLayout() 
    }
  }

  override func layoutSubviews() { 
    super.layoutSubviews()
    coolView.isHidden = !feelingCool 
  }
}
```

## Laser-Fast Launches

What can we do to improve the app launches?

- Process Forking

- This is taken care by iOS, nothing we can do

- Dynamic Linking
  - What we do here is:
    - Allocating memory for execution 
    - Linking libraries and frameworks 
    - Initialization of Swift, Objective-C, Foundation, etc. 
    - Static object initialization 
    - 40‚Äì50% of typical app launch time

- 
  - What we can do is:
    - Avoid code duplication 
    - Limit use of third-party libraries 
    - Avoid static initializers

-     
  - More info: [App Startup Time‚ÄîPast, Present, and Future][wwdc17413].

- UI Construction
  - What we do here is:
    - Prepare UI 
    - State restoration 
    - Load preferences 
    - Load model data

- 
  -  What we can do here is:
    - Return quickly from:
      - `application(_:willFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)`
      - `application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)`
      - `applicationDidBecomeActive(_:)`

- 
  - 
    - Avoid writing to disk 
    - Avoid loading very large data sets 
    - Check database hygiene

- First Frame
  - What we do here is:
    - Core Animation renders your first frame
    - Text drawing
    - Image loading and decompression

- 
  - What we can do here is:
    - Only prepare the UI you need 
    - Avoid hiding views and layers

- 
  - Extended Launch Actions

## Smooth Scrolling


Why the app stutters?

- Too much computation
  - Instrument's Time Profile will help you with that (suggested session: [Using Time Profiler in Instruments][wwdc16418])
  - Solutions: 
    - use `UICollectionView` and `UITableView` pre-fetching (suggested session: [What's New in UICollectionView in iOS 10][wwdc16219])
    - Push some work off the main queue:
      - network and file system access
      - Image drawing
      - Text sizing: 
        - `UIGraphicsImageRenderer`, and its distributed string, both have functions available that are safe to use on a background thread, that might just help you move some of that complex computation off of your main queue.

- Complex Graphics
  - Instrument's Core Animation will help you with that (session: [Advanced Graphics and Animations for iOS Apps][wwdc14419])
  - What do we mean by complex graphics? Probably Visual Effects (blur & vibrancy, avoid especially having blur over blur over blur) and Masking (and clipping)
  - Solutions:
    - Use opaque instead of blur/mask

- Suggested session: [Profiling in Depth][wwdc15412].

## Continuing with Continuity

- Everything is built on top of `NSUserActivity`, basically every device broadcast the activity it is doing to all other devices (of the same user) in the vicinity.  
This makes an icon appear (on the dock on a mac, on the app switcher on the iPhone) and, if you tap it, iOS/macOS will launch that app and call. 
`func application(_ application: UIApplication, continue userActivity: NSUserActivity, restorationHandler: @escaping ([Any]?) -> Void) -> Bool` in your app delegate, passing the activity that was publicized by the other user (note that this takes a few seconds in iOS 10/11, should be much faster in iOS 12).

- This is an example of `NSUserActivity`:

```swift
// NSUserActivity 
// Originating Device 

let activity = NSUserActivity(activityType:"com.apple.developer.video")
activity.title = "Adding, Delight to your iOS App"
activity.isEligibleForHandoff = true
activity.userInfo = ["session-id": "2018-223", "currentTime": 2340]
userActivity = activity 
```

In the userInfo dictionary you must put all the necessary information that will enable the user/app to continue the activity in another device.
the last line assign the activity to the ViewController userActivity, making it really the current activity

- On the receiving device, this is what we need to do:
![][userActivityContinueImage]
note how the first function is called right away when the user touches the icon (on the app switcher or the dock), while the second, as I said above, is called after a few seconds with the whole `NSUserActivity` payload (it doesn't matter how little info there is inside, it still will take a while üòë, in my apps I just put two or four strings of less than 20 chars each, and it still takes forever...)

- If we need more info that it can be fit in a dictionary, you can use `NSUserActivity` Continuation Streams
![][streamImage]
this stream allow a continuous talk between devices, but we need to do this fast, as probably the user is moving the two devices apart (like continuing the activity from a mac to an iPad because the user has to leave home)

- Document based apps get this `NSUserActivity` for free

- If you don't have a mac app, you can hand off to a website via safari! You'll need to set the `webpageURL` property to the user activity.

- You can also do the opposite, from website to app (session Adopting Handoff on iOS and OS X)

## Debugging Like a Pro

- ‚ö†Ô∏èThese tools are meant to be used only during debugging, if you submit an app to the app store with these you'll get rejected.

- For Views debugging:
  - `-[UIView recursiveDescription];` will print the subviews hierarchy (with frame info, gesture recognizers, properties like isHidden)
  - `-[UIView parentDescription];` like above, but for parents view instead of subviews
  - `+[UIViewController _printHierarchy];` shows all of our presenting viewControllers, our presented viewControllers, our parentViewControllers and childViewControllers, and even our presentationControllers.

- Debugging State Issues:
  - use expr (e) command on lldb (check sessions [Debugging with LLDB][wwdc12415], and [Advanced Swift Debugging in LLDB][wwdc14410])
  - use `dump` to print all your swift objects and properties (obj-c: `-[NSObject _ivarDescription]`)
