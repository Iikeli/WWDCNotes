# Accessibility Inspector

The Accessibility Inspector enables you to identify parts of your app that are not accessible. It provides feedback on how you can make them accessible, as well as simulating voice-over to help you identify what a Voice Over user would experience. Watch a live-demo of an app being fully debugged in the Accessibility Inspector, and learn how to leverage this powerful tool to make your apps better for everyone.
