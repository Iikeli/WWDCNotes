Application loader app is no more: there’s a new app called Transporter instead.

Testflight got some new features:

- Take screenshot to send feedback
- Prompt to send feedback when a crash occurs
- On the first launch of a new build, there’s a new onboarding screen, displaying the developer test notes. (would be cool to have the same when apps update!)
