## HEIC Images

Use HEIC instead of jpeg (~50% the size, similar quality).

It also let:

- to Store auxiliary images (depth, disparity, and so on) 
- Supports alpha
- Lossless compression
- Multiple images in a single container 

Available from iOS 11.

## Assets Catalog

Use AssetsCatalog for free optimizations like app slicing and more.

## Drive Usage

Try to minimize read/write of files in disk, even on small files (<4KB).
Donâ€™t use `info.plist` and JSON files as databases, use core data instead.

CoreData has CloudKit integration with iOS 13.

Lots of tips on SQLite performance.

## File Activity Instrument

Use the File Activity Instrument to see how your app behaves file-wise.

The session ends with a 10 minutes overview on the file activity instrument, where the guy explains how to use the system cache as much as possible.
