# Getting Started with Xcode

Xcode is the development environment for creating great apps for Apple platforms. Find out how to take advantage of Xcode features to go all the way from a new project to App Store distribution. Along the way, you'll learn how to navigate the Xcode user interface, how to take advantage of the source editor and live user interface previews, how to incorporate community-developed Swift packages into your app, and how to refactor and test your code, all while developing a working SwiftUI app.
