- Turning an iPad app to a macOS app doesnâ€™t take much effort
- Apps should be ported to mac only when it mac sense (no AR or Navigation apps for example)
- We get lots of things for free: split views, file browser, contextual menus, copy/paste
- No all UI designed for touch interfaces translate well to mac, buttons should be much smaller.
- Donâ€™t take for granted that all the touch gestures are available for mac (all of them are if the user uses a trackpad tho).
- UI put on the bottom of the screen for reachability doesnâ€™t make sense on the mac, every pixel is reachable the same in a mac window.
iOS text is sized down to 77% its original size on macOS. (e.g. default size 17 points becomes 13 points)
- Some macOS machines still use @1x ðŸ˜±
- Tabs and other elements should be ported to the equivalent on mac (see more in link below)
- Lots of customized colors should not be used to macOS (e.g. a tabBar with a bright custom color as background), macOS should be more neutral (because itâ€™s possible that the user has multiple windows open, even not from the same app, so we should let the user focus on the content as much as possible)
- We must do some work to support things like:
  - Toolbars
  - appIcon (the iOS version is not macOS-like, we should have a macOS version)
  - Contextual menus (be succinct in the actions names)
  - Menu bars
  - Touch bars (yes we get this even for iPad apps that run on MacOS)
  - macOS also has a gesture that iOS doesnâ€™t have (at least by default): hover events! We should user this event if necessary/useful

Apple has a very nice overview on what steps to take in order to bring an iPadOS app to macOS in the iOS HIG [here](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/overview/ipad-apps-for-mac/).
