- Innovation
  - Subverts expectations
  - Question basic assumptions
  - Convert problems into ideas

Basically throw out of the window what is the current standard and start from scratch, focus on the best experience for the given platform.

- Fits into the flow of real life (no obstacles, external requirements)
- Non-disruptive: provide value without getting in the way

Anything that makes the user more confident in using your app is great.

- Trust
  - Attribution: the user can see, can cause and effect. It’s empowering
  - You can trust an app when the way it works feels transparent
  - Offer ways to adjust app intelligence

- Refinement
  - Explore your ideas
  - Take your time
  - Draw inspiration from the real world (think like the calculator app) but make sure it doesn’t conflict with the expectations from a digital UI
  - Don’t be afraid to throw things away

- Aesthetics
  - Avoid displaying too much information at any given time, show only what matters, remove clutter as much as possible
  - The goal is to get people concentrated and present in the current moment
  - Create a consistent design language 
  - Layout every screen side by side 
  - Design for the platform

- Inclusion
  - Make your app as accessible as possible

- Attention to detail
  - Attention to detail makes your app stands out from the crowd
