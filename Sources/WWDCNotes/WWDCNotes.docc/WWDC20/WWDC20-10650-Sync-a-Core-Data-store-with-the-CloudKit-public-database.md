# Sync a Core Data store with the CloudKit public database

Discover how Core Data can help you adopt the CloudKit public database in your app with as little as one line of code. Learn how to easily manage the flow of data through your app and in and out of CloudKit. We’ll show you how to combine the complementary power of Core Data and the CloudKit public database to allow people to access — and contribute to — data, such as high scores or application templates. 

To familiarize yourself with the CloudKit Database, check out our “CKDatabase” documentation, and to learn more about CloudKit integration, read “Mirroring a Core Data Store with CloudKit.”
