## What is CareKit?

CareKit is an open-source framework that helps you build beautiful care apps. 

Three components:

- CareKitUI: provides static views that are perfect for displaying that data.
- CareKitStore: provides health flavored data models and a core data layer for persistence.
- CareKit: ties the UI and store layers together by providing synchronization between the two

## What's new

- CareKitUI:
  - Some UIKit views now also have a SwiftUI variant
  - New SwiftUI-exclusive views

- CareKit:
  - Synchronized SwiftUI views
  - WatchOS support (via SwiftUI)

- CareKitStore:
  - You can now use data in HealthKit alongside CareKit data to create HealthKit-driven tasks
  - [FHIR][FHIR] compatibility via the new `CareKitFHIR` package
