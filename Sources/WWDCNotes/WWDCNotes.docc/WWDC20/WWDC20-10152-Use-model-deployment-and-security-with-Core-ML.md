# Use model deployment and security with Core ML

Discover how to deploy Core ML models outside of your app binary, giving you greater flexibility and control when bringing machine learning features to your app. And learn how Core ML Model Deployment enables you to deliver revised models to your app without requiring an app update. We‚Äôll also walk you through how you can protect custom machine learning models through encryption, and preview your model performance in Xcode.

For more information on working with Core ML, including bringing over models trained in environments like TensorFlow and PyTorch, we also recommend watching "Get your models on device using Core ML Converters.‚Äù
