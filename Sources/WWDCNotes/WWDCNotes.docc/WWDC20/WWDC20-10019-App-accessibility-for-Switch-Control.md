# App accessibility for Switch Control

Switch Control is a powerful accessibility technology for anyone with very limited mobility. The feature is available natively on iOS, and you can create an even better Switch Control experience in your app with tips, tricks, and a few APIs. Weâ€™ll walk you through how people use Switch Control, as well as provide best practices for supporting it in your app effectively. 

To get the most out of this session, you should be familiar with general accessibility principles and VoiceOver accessibility APIs. Check out "Making Apps More Accessible With Custom Actions," "Writing Great Accessibility Labels, and "VoiceOver: App Testing Beyond The Visuals" for more information.
