# What's new in Web Inspector

The Web Inspector makes introspection and debugging simpler than ever. Discover how you can use debugger stepping, editing cookies, and overriding network loaded resources to provide you with powerful development capabilities and help you create faster, more efficient websites.

## Web Inspector changes

- the toolbar and dashboard are now merged into a tab bar (to save on vertical space)
- tightened the spacing around many controls (allowing you to see more content)
- Dark Mode variants for all of the icons throughout Web Inspector
- possibility to toggle Dark Mode independently from the rest of the system in the Settings Tab

## New tabs Sources

![][sourcesImage]

Overview:

- lists all resources loaded by the inspected page since Web Inspector was opened, including long-lived things like 'WebSocket's or more ephemeral things like XHRs or 'fetch's.
- primary place for JavaScript debugging, containing all of the JavaScript debugger stepping controls and many of the breakpoint adding capabilities
- used for network overriding capabilities
- When ispecting a response or part of a request, beside raw, we can also display the content as a `DOM Tree` (in case of web sources) or `Object Tree` (in case of JSON responses)

### Local overrides

![][localOverridesImage]

- allow you to modify resources loaded over the network
- Clicking the local override button (highlighted above) automatically copies the current contents of the displayed resource into a new local override for that resource.
- Once we change the resource, refresh the page and the override will take place
- by right-clicking on a local override in Web Inspector, we can select the "Edit Local Overrideâ€¦" action where it's also possible to modify the HTTP status code or any HTTP headers as well
- non-text resources, like images, can also be overridden and fully configured
- preserved across sessions of both the inspected page and Web Inspector itself

### Inspector Bootstrap Script

- we can be add a Inspector Bootstrap Script from the add resource button in the bottom corner of the navigation sidebar in the Sources Tab
- it's a way to modify the JavaScript API surface itself. 
- The contents of the Inspector Bootstrap Script are guaranteed to run before anything else in the inspected page.
- preserved across sessions of both the inspected page and Web Inspector itself

### New Javascript Breakpoints

- Debugger Statements breakpoint: controls whether or not JavaScript execution is paused at 'debugger' statements. 
- All Microtasks breakpoint: pauses JavaScript execution whenever any microtask is about to be executed (such as from 'Promise' objects or the 'queueMicrotask()' global function)
- All Animation Frames breakpoint: same as above, but for 'requestAnimationFrame' callbacks. 
- All Timeouts breakpoint: same as above, but for 'setTimeout' callbacks
- All Intervals breakpoint: same as above, but for 'setInterval' callbacks
- All Events breakpoint: pauses before any callback is invoked for any event listener, even those unrelated to the DOM

### Script blackboxing 

- defers any JavaScript debugger pauses that would occur in a script to pause at the first expression to execute outside of that script.
- useful to avoid global breakpoints to stop within jquery for example 

### Step debugger action

![][stepImage]

- resumes and re-pauses Javascript execution before the next expression in the current call frame
- basically a shortcut for Step in and Step outs

## Timelane Tab

Overview:

- captures activity in the inspected page
- plots records based on category
- import/export recording

What's new:

- new `Media & Animations` timeline
  - captures events related to media elements
  - captures the lifecycle of CSS animations and CSS transitions

## Storage Tab

Overview:

- enumerates data stored in the browser (cookies, LocalStorage, IndexDB, ..)

What's new:

- Provides filtering to find specific data
- Enhancements on editing and deleting data

## New Graphics Tab

- replaces the canvas tab
- shows preview for all `<canvas>` contexts and shaders
- supports recording Javascript API calls of `<canvas>` contexts
- (new) lists all web/css animations, CSS transitions

## New Layers Tab

![][layersImage]

- shows a live view of the layer tree of the inspected page
- lists the memory cost and the paint count for each layer

## Console tab

Overview:

- Lists all logs from the inspected page
- Allows arbitrary JavaScript evaluation
- Exposes special engine functionality

What's new:

- many new console functions:
  - `queryInstances(className)` will return an array of all objects that inherit from `className` 
  - `queryHolders(instanceName)` will return an array of all objects in the entire JavaScript heap that have a strong reference to `instanceName`

## Enable Intelligent Tracking Prevention Debug Mode

- new Developer menu option
- if active,  all debug logging from Safari's Intelligent Tracking Prevention will appear in the Web Inspector Console, and in the macOS system Console.app
