# Configure and link your App Clips

App Clips are small parts of an app that offer a streamlined, direct experience and help people get what they need at the right time. Learn how you can invoke an App Clip through real-world experiences like App Clip Codes, NFC, and QR codes, or have them appear digitally through apps like Maps or Safari. We‚Äôll show you how to handle links in your App Clip and demonstrate how to set up your associated domains. And discover how you can configure App Clip experiences in App Store Connect, add App Clip banners to your website, and thoroughly test your App Clips through TestFlight.

To get the most out of this session, you should have experience using Universal Links and associated domains. For a primer, watch ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs New in Universal Links‚Äù from WWDC19.
