# XCTSkip your tests

Get the test results that matter — and skip the ones that don’t. Discover how you can implement XCTSkip to conditionally avoid tests at runtime. We'll take you through how to return this new test result and better document tests beyond pass and fail within your test bundle.

To get the most out of this session, you should be familiar with XCTest and unit/UI testing. Watch “Testing in Xcode” for a primer.

Once you’ve learned about XCTSkip, learn more about improvements in testing: Watch "Triage test failures with XCTIssue", "Handle interruptions and alerts in UI tests", "Get your test results faster", and "Eliminate animation hitches with XCTest".

To learn how to improve your testing suites, check out "Write tests to fail".
