# Introducing Car Keys

You can now store car keys on iPhone or Apple Watch. You no longer have to bring your key fob to unlock and start your car. And with digital keys, it's easy to share them with family or friends, and manage keys remotely.

This session is intended for automakers who want to adopt digital car keys in their vehicles. We'll talk about the core feature set including owner pairing, transactions (when you unlock or start your car), key sharing, and key management. Learn about the car key architecture and how it ensures security and privacy. Get information on where to go next for information on hardware and specifications.
