## Showing a SwiftUI live view

After opening a playground:

1. import the [`PlaygroundSupport`][psDoc] framework, which lets us customize the behavior of the playground, including showing live views

```swift
import PlaygroundSupport
```

2. set the playground live view with the your view /

```swift
PlaygroundPage.current.setLiveView(WWDCNotesView())
```

3. tap the `Run my Code` button in the bottom right of the screen to show the live view.
