# What's new in PencilKit

PencilKit helps power creativity, writing, drawing, and animation in your iPad apps. Explore the latest improvements to our drawing and annotation framework, and discover how you can take advantage of APIs like PKToolPicker, PKCanvasView, and PKStroke to support new features in illustration and writing apps. 

To get the most out of this session, you should have a basic understanding of PencilKit. If you want to a refresher, ‚ÄúIntroduction to PencilKit‚Äù from WWDC19 is a great place to start.
