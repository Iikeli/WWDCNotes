# Explore App Clips

Help people experience the right parts of your app at the exact moment they need them. Weâ€™ll explain how to design and build an App Clip â€” a small part of your app that focuses on a specific task â€” and make it easily discoverable. Learn how to focus your App Clip on short and fast interactions and identify contextually-relevant situations where you can surface it, like a search in Maps or at a real-world location through QR codes, NFC, or App Clip codes. Find out a few key differences between apps and App Clips, and explore how App Clips interact with their corresponding apps.
