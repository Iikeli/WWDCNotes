# Unsafe Swift

What exactly makes code ‚Äúunsafe‚Äù? Join the Swift team as we take a look at the programming language‚Äôs safety precautions ‚Äî and when you might need to reach for unsafe operations. We‚Äôll take a look at APIs that can cause unexpected states if not used correctly, and how you can write code more specifically to avoid undefined behavior. Learn how to work with C APIs that use pointers and the steps to take when you want to use Swift‚Äôs unsafe pointer APIs.

To get the most out of this session, you should have some familiarity with Swift and the C programming language. And for more information on working with pointers, check out "Safely Manage Pointers in Swift".
