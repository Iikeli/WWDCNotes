# Unsafe Swift

What exactly makes code ‚Äúunsafe‚Äù? Join the Swift team as we take a look at the programming language‚Äôs safety precautions ‚Äî and when you might need to reach for unsafe operations. We‚Äôll take a look at APIs that can cause unexpected states if not used correctly, and how you can write code more specifically to avoid undefined behavior. Learn how to work with C APIs that use pointers and the steps to take when you want to use Swift‚Äôs unsafe pointer APIs.
