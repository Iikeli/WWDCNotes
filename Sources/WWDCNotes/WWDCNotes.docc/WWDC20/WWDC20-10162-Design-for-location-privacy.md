# Design for location privacy

When someone uses iPhone or iPad, they have control over how their location is shared with the apps they use â€” including sharing an approximate location rather than precise coordinates. This creates a more private experience across their device, and it impacts all apps that rely on location data or use it to supplement certain elements of their experience.
