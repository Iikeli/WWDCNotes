# Inspect, modify, and construct PencilKit drawings

Make Apple Pencil an even more useful tool for drawing and writing within your app. With PencilKit, you can delve into the strokes, inks, paths, and points that comprise a drawing, use these to build features that use recognition, and modify drawings in response to input. Discover how you can dynamically generate shapes and drawings and learn more about APIs like PKDrawings and PKStrokes.
