# Safely manage pointers in Swift

Come with us as we delve into unsafe pointer types in Swift. Discover the requirements for each type and how to use it correctly. Weâ€™ll discuss typed pointers, drop down to raw pointers, and finally circumvent pointer type safety entirely by binding memory.

This session is a follow-up to "Unsafe Swift" from WWDC20. To get the most out of it, you should be familiar with Swift and the C programming language.
