# Refine Objective-C frameworks for Swift

Fine-tune your Objective-C headers to work beautifully in Swift. Weâ€™ll show you how to take an unwieldy Objective-C framework and transform it into an API that feels right at home. Learn about the suite of annotations you can use to provide richer type information, more idiomatic names, and better errors to Swift. And discover Objective-C conventions you might not have known about that are key to a well-behaved Swift API.
