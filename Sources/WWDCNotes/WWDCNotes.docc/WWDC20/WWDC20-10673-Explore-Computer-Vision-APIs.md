# Explore Computer Vision APIs

Learn how to bring Computer Vision intelligence to your app when you combine the power of Core Image, Vision, and Core ML. Go beyond machine learning alone and gain a deeper understanding of images and video. Discover new APIs in Core Image and Vision to bring Computer Vision to your application like new thresholding filters as well as Contour Detection and Optical Flow. And consider ways to use Core Image for preprocessing and visualization of these results.

To learn more about the underlying frameworks see "Vision Framework: Building on Core ML" and "Core Image: Performance, Prototyping, and Python." And to further explore Computer Vision APIs, be sure to check out the "Detect Body and Hand Pose with Vision" and "Explore the Action & Vision app" sessions.
