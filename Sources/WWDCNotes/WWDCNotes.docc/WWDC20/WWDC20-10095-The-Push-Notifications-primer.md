# The Push Notifications primer

Help people get the most out of your app with push notifications for important events and updates â€” and by delivering up-to-date data in the background, so that it is ready when they open your app. Discover how you can use notifications and alert people to timely and relevant information. Learn the differences between alert and background notifications, how to adopt them in your apps, and avoid mistakes by using the right APIs for the job.
