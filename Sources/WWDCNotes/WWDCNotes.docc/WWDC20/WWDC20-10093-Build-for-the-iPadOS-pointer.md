# Build for the iPadOS pointer

Help people who use iPad with a Magic Keyboard, mouse, trackpad or other input device get the most out of your app. We‚Äôll show you how to add customizations to the pointer on iPad using pointer interaction APIs, create pointer effects for your buttons and custom views, and change the pointer shape in specific areas of your app to highlight them.

To learn more about pointer interactions on iPad and to get the most out of this session, we recommend also watching ‚ÄúDesign for the iPadOS pointer‚Äù and ‚ÄúHandle trackpad and mouse input.‚Äù
