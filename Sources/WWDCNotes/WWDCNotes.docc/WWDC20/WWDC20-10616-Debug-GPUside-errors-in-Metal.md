# Debug GPU-side errors in Metal

Track down even the trickiest GPU-side programming errors with enhanced reporting in Xcode 12. While Metalâ€™s API validation layer can catch most problems in a project, GPU errors can cause a host of difficult-to-debug issues.

Get an introduction to GPU-side errors and learn how to find and eliminate problems like visual corruption, infinite loop timeouts, out of bounds memory accesses, nil resource access, or invalid resource residency with Xcode 12. Discover how to enable enhanced command buffer error reporting and shader validation, use them effectively as part of your debugging strategy, and automate them in your production pipeline.
