# Meet WidgetKit

Meet WidgetKit: the best way to bring your appâ€™s most useful information directly to the home screen. We'll show you what makes a great widget and take a look at WidgetKit's features and functionality. Learn how to get started creating a widget, and find out how WidgetKit leverages the power of SwiftUI to provide a stateless experience. Discover how to harness your existing proactive technologies to make sure your widget surfaces relevant material. And create a Timeline that ensures your content is always fresh.

For more on creating widgets, check out "Build SwiftUI views for widgets" and "The widgets code-along."
