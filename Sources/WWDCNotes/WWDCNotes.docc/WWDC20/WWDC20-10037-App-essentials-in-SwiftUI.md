# App essentials in SwiftUI

Thanks to the new App protocol, SwiftUI now supports building entire apps! See how Apps, Scenes, and Views fit together.

Easily add expected functionality to your interface using the new commands modifier, and explore the ins and outs of the new WindowGroup API.

To get the most out of this session, you should have some experience with SwiftUI. Watch “Introduction to SwiftUI” for a primer.
