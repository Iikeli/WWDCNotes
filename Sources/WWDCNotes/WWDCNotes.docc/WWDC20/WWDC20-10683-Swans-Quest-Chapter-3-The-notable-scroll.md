# Swan's Quest, Chapter 3: The notable scroll

Swift Playgrounds presents "Swan‚Äôs Quest,‚Äù an interactive adventure in four chapters for all ages. Calling all musicians! In this chapter, our Hero has found a mysterious scroll of music, and only you can help decode it. (Don‚Äôt worry if you can‚Äôt read music, our clever Lizard is standing by to assist. It‚Äôs sure to be a note-worthy experience.)

By learning a little theory, and mastering time to create tones of different lengths, you just might help our Hero face the music‚Ä¶ and move onto the next part of their quest.

Swan‚Äôs Quest was created for Swift Playgrounds on iPad and Mac, combining frameworks and resources which power the educational experiences in many of our playgrounds, including Sonic Workshop, Sensor Arcade, and Augmented Reality. To learn more about building your own playgrounds, be sure to watch "Create Swift Playgrounds content for iPad and Mac".

And don‚Äôt forget to stop by the Developer Forums and share your solution for our side quest.
