# Become a Simulator expert

Simulator runs your iOS, iPadOS, tvOS, or watchOS apps directly on your Mac ‚Äî no separate device required. We‚Äôll give you a tour of the app's latest tools and features and show you how to sharpen your Simulator skills. Discover how to test pointer and trackpad support, adjust Simulator preferences, and use command line tools like simctl to help you simulate push notifications in a development environment.

While you can get a quick overview of Simulator in this session, for more detailed information about the tool you may want to refresh yourself on ‚ÄúGetting the Most Out of Simulator‚Äù from WWDC19.
