# Port your Mac app to Apple silicon

Your porting questions, answered: Learn how to recompile your macOS app for Apple silicon Macs and build universal apps that launch faster, have better performance, and support the future of the platform. Weâ€™ll show you how Xcode makes it simple to build a universal macOS binary and go through running, debugging, and testing your app. Learn what changes to low-level code you might need to make, find out how to handle in-process and out-of-process plug-ins, and discover some useful tips for working with universal apps.

## What the transition to Apple Silicon means

|  | Apple Silicon Mac | Intel-based Mac |
| Native architecture | arm 64 | x86_64 |
| Supported architectures | arm64 (native), x86_64 (translated via Rosetta) | x86_64 |

In macOS 11, when running on Apple silicon, the CPU tab of the Activity Monitor.app has a new `Kind` column showing which architecture each process runs on ("`Apple`"  means it's running natively in Apple Silicon, `Intel` when the process is being translated via Rosetta):

### Universal Mach-O binaries

Your apps and most executable code in macOS, are stored in a file format called [Mach-O][machowiki]. 

These files can either be targeting a single CPU architecture or they can be universal (a.k.a. support multiple CPU architectures). 

To examine a file on disk, you can use the `lipo` command.

### Rosetta translation

- the entire process is either native or translated (cannot mix). 
- Kernel extensions, AVX vector instructions, and virtualization are not supported.

## Building Universal Binaries

- endianness of arm64 is the same as x86
- if your (macOS) app shares code with an iOS app, that code is guarantee to work in Apple Silicon
- Xcode 12 supports building Universal Binaries on all mac architectures (both on Intel and Apple Silicon macs)

### Determining CPU page size

- Native page size on Intel is `4 kB`, on Apple Silicon it's `16 kB`: therefore the `PAGE_SIZE` macro is no longer a constant. Use:
  - `PAGE_MAX_SIZE` for a compile-time upper bound
  - `vm_page_size` to read the actual value at runtime

- Rosetta provides 4 KB pages when translating Intel processes

### #if for platforms and CPU architectures

- macOS: `#if os(macOS)`
- intel: `#if arch(x86_64)`
- ARM64: `#if arch(arm64)`
- Simulator: `#if targetEnvironment(simulator)`
- iOS device: `#if os(iOS) && !targetEnvironment(simulator)`

### Precompiled binaries

When building for Apple Silicon you might encounter linker warnings (that later translate in some cryptic errors) similar to: `ignoring file when building for macOS-arm64, but attempting to link with file built for macOS-x86_64.`.

This happens when we have a binary dependency that hasn't been built as universal yet, the only way to fix this is to:

- remove such dependency (even just temporarily)
- wait for the dependency to provide an universal binary

What you can do now: search for precompiled binaries in your project (`.a`, `.dylib`, `.framework`, `.xcframework`) and reach out their vendors if the binary is not universal (use `lipo --info path/to/binary` to inspect them)

### Building Universal Binaries steps

1. Build your app as an Intel app in Xcode 12 first (make sure it builds fine with no warnings)
2. Build your app natively for Apple Silicon 
  - fix non-portable code issues (see #if chapter above)
  - fix link-time issues (see `Precompiled binaries` chapter above)

## Running, Testing, Debugging

- When running tests, they will run only in the selected architecture
- The default architecture is the one the mac machine is running on
- Always run your tests on both architectures

## Asymmetric CPU cores on Apple Silicon

- Apple Silicon Macs have two types of cores:
  - High-performance (P Cores)
  - Energy-efficient (E Cores)

- All can be active at the same time for highly-parallel workloads

In Instruments you can see which core is which by the associated label:

## Plug-ins

- Plug-ins are a way to dynamically load and execute code.
- Both native and translated plug-ins are supported.
- If your app is a plug-in host, and if it's using a custom plug-in loading mechanism, you will need to consider how plug-ins work on Apple Silicon Macs.

If your app supports plug-ins, it will typically discover them at runtime and then load them when needed.

That's called an **in-process plug-in model**, and typically the app uses a call to [`dlopen()`][dlopen] or [`Bundle.load()`][bundleLoad] for this.

Alternatively, the plug-ins can be spawned as new processes, and we call those **out-of-process plug-ins**. The app and the plug-in process then use some interprocess communication mechanism like XPC. Loading another plug-in typically spawns another process.

|  | 1st party (build from source code shipped inside your app) | 3rd party (precompiled binaries, shipped inside the app or separately) |
| Out-of-process | Supported | Supported, even when the binary is intel only (Rosetta will take care of that process) |
| In-process | Supported only if the running architecture matches the one in the precompiled binary) | not supported |
