# Port your Mac app to Apple silicon

Your porting questions, answered: Learn how to recompile your macOS app for Apple silicon Macs and build universal apps that launch faster, have better performance, and support the future of the platform. Weâ€™ll show you how Xcode makes it simple to build a universal macOS binary and go through running, debugging, and testing your app. Learn what changes to low-level code you might need to make, find out how to handle in-process and out-of-process plug-ins, and discover some useful tips for working with universal apps.

Weâ€™ve designed this session for experienced macOS developers who want to get their existing apps running natively on Apple silicon Macs. You can learn more about doing so in the Apple silicon documentation.
