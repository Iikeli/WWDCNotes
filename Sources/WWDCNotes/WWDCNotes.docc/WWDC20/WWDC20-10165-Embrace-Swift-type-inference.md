# Embrace Swift type inference

Swift uses type inference to help you write clean, concise code without compromising type safety. Weâ€™ll show you how the compiler seeks out clues in your code to solve the type inference puzzle. Discover what happens when the compiler can't come to a solution, and find out how Xcode 12 integrates error tracking to help you understand and fix mistakes at compile time.
