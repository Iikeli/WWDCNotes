# The artist’s AR toolkit

Reality Converter and Reality Composer make preparing augmented reality assets for your iOS or iPadOS app easier than ever. Discover how you can convert existing 3D assets into USDZ, bring them into Reality Composer to create AR experiences, and integrate with an existing Xcode project or export to AR Quick Look. We’ll detail how to work with assets in a variety of popular 3D formats, build and test your AR scenes, and integrate with your artist’s workflow.

To get the most out of this session, you should be familiar with USDZ and Reality Composer. Watch “Working with USD” and “Building AR Experiences with Reality Composer” for more.

And to get more details about the latest additions to USD for AR, check out “What's new in USD”.
