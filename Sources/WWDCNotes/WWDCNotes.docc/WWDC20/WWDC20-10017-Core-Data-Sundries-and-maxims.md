# Core Data: Sundries and maxims

Core Data is the central way to durably and persistently store information from your app ‚Äî and we‚Äôre going to show you how to refine that implementation for even faster data ingest and fetching. Discover how you can improve data capture with batch insert, tailor fetch requests to your data needs, and react to notifications about changes in the persistent store.

To get the most out of this session, you should know and have interacted with Core Data in the past. For more information on the framework, watch ‚ÄúMaking Apps with Core Data.‚Äù
