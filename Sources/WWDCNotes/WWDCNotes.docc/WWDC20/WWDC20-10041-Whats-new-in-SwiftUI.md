# What's new in SwiftUI

SwiftUI can help you build better and more powerful apps for iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and Apple TV.  Learn more about the latest refinements to SwiftUI, including interface improvements like outlines, grids, and toolbars. Take advantage of SwiftUIâ€™s enhanced support across Apple frameworks to enable features like Sign In with Apple. Discover new visual effects, as well as new controls and styles. And find out how the new app and scene APIs enable you to create apps entirely in SwiftUI, as well as custom complications and all new widgets.

To get the most out of this session, you should be familiar with SwiftUI. Watch "Introduction to SwiftUI" for a primer.
