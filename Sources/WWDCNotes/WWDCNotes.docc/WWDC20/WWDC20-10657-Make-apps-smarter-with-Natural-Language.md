# Make apps smarter with Natural Language

Explore how you can leverage the Natural Language framework to better analyze and understand text. Learn how to draw meaning from text using the framework's built-in word and sentence embeddings, and how to create your own custom embeddings for specific needs.

We’ll show you how to use samples to train a custom text classifier or word tagger to extract important pieces of information out of text— all powered by the transfer learning algorithms in Natural Language. Find out how you can create apps that can answer user questions, recognize similarities in text, and find relevant documents, images, and more.

To get the most out of this session, you should have a basic understanding of the Natural Language framework. For an overview, watch “Introducing Natural Language Framework” and “Advances in Natural Language Framework.” You can also brush up on model training using Create ML through “Introducing the Create ML App.”
