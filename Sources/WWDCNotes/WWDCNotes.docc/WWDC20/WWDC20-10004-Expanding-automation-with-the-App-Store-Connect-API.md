# Expanding automation with the App Store Connect API

Make routine tasks in App Store Connect a thing of the past when you automate your workflow with the App Store Connect API. Learn how you can manage more about your presence on the App Store with the App Metadata API, or use the new Power and Performance Metrics and Diagnostics API to access the same aggregate data that drives the Power and Performance analysis tools in Xcode. Whether youâ€™re managing team members and provisioning profiles, adding or removing beta testers, or downloading your sales and financial reports, this comprehensive API makes automation of these processes a snap.
