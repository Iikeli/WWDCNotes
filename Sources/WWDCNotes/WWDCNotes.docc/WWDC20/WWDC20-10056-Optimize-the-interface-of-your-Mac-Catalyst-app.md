# Optimize the interface of your Mac Catalyst app

Discover how to tailor your Mac Catalyst app so that it looks and feels even more at home on the Mac by using the new ‚ÄúOptimize Interface for Mac‚Äù option in Xcode. Explore new layout and appearance options for Catalyst apps, and learn how they can provide you with graphical performance gains, sharper text, and an interface designed specifically for Apple‚Äôs desktops and laptops. We‚Äôll show you how to take advantage of these options and provide best practices for organizing your code when developing for multiple platforms.

Developers actively working on a Mac Catalyst project will get the most out of watching this session. If you‚Äôre new to Catalyst, we recommend watching ‚ÄúDesigning iPad Apps for Mac‚Äù and "Introducing iPad Apps for Mac" for an introduction.
