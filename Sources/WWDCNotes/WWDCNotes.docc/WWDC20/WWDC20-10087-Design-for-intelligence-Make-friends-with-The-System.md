# Design for intelligence: Make friends with "The System"

The building blocks of the intelligent system are simple: Define, learn, execute. Discover how you can use intents to define your app's key features, create donations to help the system learn and make predictions about the future, and implement extensibility to ensure your app is ready to execute at just the right moment. Learn from teams at Apple about how their technologies use intents and donations in different ways, all for the same goal: to make the everyday easier.
