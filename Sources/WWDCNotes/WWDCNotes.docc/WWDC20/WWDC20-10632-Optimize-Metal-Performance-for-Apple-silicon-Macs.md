# Optimize Metal Performance for Apple silicon Macs

Apple silicon Macs are a transformative new platform for graphics-intensive apps ‚Äî and we‚Äôre going to show you how to fire up the GPU to create blazingly fast apps and games.

Discover how to take advantage of Apple‚Äôs unique Tile-Based Deferred Rendering (TBDR) GPU architecture within Apple silicon Macs and learn how to schedule workloads to provide maximum throughput, structure your rendering pipeline, and increase overall efficiency. And dive deep with our graphics team as we explore shader optimizations for the Apple GPU shader core.

We‚Äôve designed this session in tandem with ‚ÄúBring your Metal app to Apple silicon Macs,‚Äù and recommend you watch that first.

For more, watch ‚ÄúHarness Apple GPUs with Metal‚Äù to learn how TBDR applies to a variety of modern rendering techniques.
