# Meet Scribble for iPad

Scribble offers a lightweight, ergonomic, and enjoyable way of entering text on iPad with Apple Pencil. Discover how people can take advantage of Scribble and handwritten text in apps that use standard text input controls or that implement a custom text editing experience. You’ll learn how it integrates into TextKit, and when you’ll need to adopt the new UIScribbleInteraction and UIIndirectScribbleInteraction APIs to provide a delightful and consistent experience with Scribble in your app.

To get the most out of this session, you should be familiar with UIKit text input controls, as well as keyboard input technologies. To get started, watch “Keyboard Input in iOS”. If you’re building a custom text editor, you should be familiar with the UITextInput protocol, TextKit, and related text input APIs. For more information, we recommend checking out “TextKit Best Practices” and “The Keys to a Better Text Input Experience.” And for design guidelines on pencil-based interaction, check out “Apple Pencil Design Essentials.”
