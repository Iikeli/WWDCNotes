# Meet Scribble for iPad

Scribble offers a lightweight, ergonomic, and enjoyable way of entering text on iPad with Apple Pencil. Discover how people can take advantage of Scribble and handwritten text in apps that use standard text input controls or that implement a custom text editing experience. Youâ€™ll learn how it integrates into TextKit, and when youâ€™ll need to adopt the new UIScribbleInteraction and UIIndirectScribbleInteraction APIs to provide a delightful and consistent experience with Scribble in your app.
