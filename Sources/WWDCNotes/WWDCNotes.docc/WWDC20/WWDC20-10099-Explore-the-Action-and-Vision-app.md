# Explore the Action & Vision app

It's now easy to create an app for fitness or sports coaching that takes advantage of machine learning&nbsp;â€”&nbsp;and to prove it, we built our own. Learn how we designed the Action & Vision app using Object Detection and Action Classification in Create ML along with the new Body Pose Estimation, Trajectory Detection, and Contour Detection features in the Vision framework. Explore how you can create an immersive application for gameplay or training from setup to analysis and feedback. And follow along in Xcode with a full sample project.
