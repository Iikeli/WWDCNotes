# Tap into Game Center: Dashboard, Access Point, and Profile

Apple’s social gaming network is ready to play. We’ll walk you through the latest updates to Game Center, starting with its in-game interface and all-new player experience. Learn how to integrate GameKit into your app and authenticate players effectively, and discover the Access Point, which brings players into the in-game dashboard. From there, we’ll explore player profiles and their options for privacy.
