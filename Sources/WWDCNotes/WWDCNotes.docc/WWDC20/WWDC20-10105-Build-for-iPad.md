# Build for iPad

Learn how to improve iPad apps to leverage the increased screen size and additional features of iPadOS, and help people accomplish more with their devices. Discover how you can build detailed multi-column layouts and integrate lists into your app with little adjustment to your existing code. We‚Äôll also explore reducing modality within your views to make it easier to navigate your interface with fewer taps and touches.

To get the most out of this session, you should have a general understanding of iPad app layouts and UIKit. For more information, watch ‚ÄúMaking Apps Adaptive, Part 1.‚Äù And while not necessary, familiarity with UICollectionView may also be helpful. Watch ‚ÄúAdvances in Collection View Layout‚Äù for an overview.
