# AutoFill everywhere

Discover how to implement AutoFill in your app and help people enter their information into fields easily, privately, and securely. Learn how to help the system to give better suggestions that tailor to your app's functionality: offer smart location suggestions within a navigation app, for example, or provide a private way to input contact information into fields from the QuickType bar.

In macOS Big Sur, AutoFill has been extended beyond Safari, to apps. Learn about the small changes that you can make to take advantage of this feature and bring convenience, added security, and a frictionless experience to people using your macOS apps.
