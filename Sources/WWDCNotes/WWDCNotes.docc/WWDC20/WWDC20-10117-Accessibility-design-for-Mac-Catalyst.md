# Accessibility design for Mac Catalyst

Make your Mac Catalyst app accessible to all&nbsp;‚Äî&nbsp;and bring those improvements back to your iPad app. Discover how a great accessible iPad app automatically becomes a great accessible Mac app when adding support for Mac Catalyst. Learn how to further augment your experience with support for mouse and keyboard actions and accessibility element grouping and navigation. And explore how to use new Accessibility Inspector features to test your app and iterate to create a truly great experience for everyone.

To get the most out of this session, you should be familiar with Mac Catalyst, UIKit, and basic accessibility APIs for iOS. To get started, check out ‚ÄúIntroducing iPad apps for Mac‚Äù and "Auditing your apps for accessibility."
