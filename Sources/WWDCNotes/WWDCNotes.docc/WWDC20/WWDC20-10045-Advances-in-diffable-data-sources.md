# Advances in diffable data sources

Diffable data sources dramatically simplify the work involved in managing and updating collection and table views to create dynamic and responsive experiences in your apps. Discover how you can use section snapshots to efficiently build lists and outline collection views for iOS and iPadOS and provide support for implementing the sidebar in an iPad app. We‚Äôll also show you how to simplify cell reordering using UICollectionViewDiffableDataSource to help you streamline your code and build app interfaces more quickly.
