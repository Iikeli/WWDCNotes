# Explore ARKit 4

ARKit 4 enables you to build the next generation of augmented reality apps to transform how people connect with the world around them. We‚Äôll walk you through the latest improvements to Apple‚Äôs augmented reality platform, including how to use Location Anchors to connect virtual objects with a real-world longitude, latitude, and altitude. Discover how to harness the LiDAR Scanner on iPad Pro and obtain a depth map of your environment. And learn how to track faces in AR on more devices, including the iPad Air (3rd generation), iPad mini (5th generation), and all devices with the A12 Bionic chip or later that have a front-facing camera. 

To get the most out of this session, you should be familiar with how your apps can take advantage of LiDAR Scanner on iPad Pro. Watch ‚ÄúAdvanced Scene Understanding in AR‚Äù for more information. 

Once you‚Äôve learned how to leverage ARKit 4 in your iOS and iPadOS apps, explore realistic rendering improvements in ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs New in RealityKit‚Äù and other ARKit features like People Occlusion and Motion Capture with ‚ÄúIntroducing ARKit 3‚Äù.
