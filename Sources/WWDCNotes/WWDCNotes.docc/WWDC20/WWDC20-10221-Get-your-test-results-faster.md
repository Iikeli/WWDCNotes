# Get your test results faster

Improve your testing suite to speed up your feedback loop and get fixes in faster. Learn more about the latest improvements to testing in Xcode, including how to leverage test plans, Xcodebuild updates, and APIs to eliminate never-ending and badly-behaved tests. We‚Äôll explore Test Timeouts and Execution Time Allowances in XCTest, examine device parallelization, and detail recommended practices for balancing performance with clear fault localization.

To get the most out of this session, you should be familiar with authoring basic tests using XCTest and managing tests through test plans. For background, watch ‚ÄúTesting in Xcode‚Äù from WWDC19.
