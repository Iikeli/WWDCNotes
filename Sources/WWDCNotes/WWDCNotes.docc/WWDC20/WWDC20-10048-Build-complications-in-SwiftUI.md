# Build complications in SwiftUI

Spice up your graphic complications on Apple Watch using SwiftUI. We‚Äôll teach you how to use custom SwiftUI views in complications on watch faces like Meridian and Infograph, look at some best practices when creating your complications, and show you how to preview your work in Xcode 12.

To get the most out of this session, you should be familiar with the basics of SwiftUI and building complications on Apple Watch. For an overview, watch ‚ÄúCreate Complications for Apple Watch‚Äù and read ‚ÄúBuilding watchOS App Interfaces with SwiftUI.‚Äù

Once you‚Äôve discovered how to build graphic complications in SwiftUI, you can combine this with other watchOS 7 features like multiple complications and Face Sharing to create a watch face packed with personality and customized for people who love your app.
