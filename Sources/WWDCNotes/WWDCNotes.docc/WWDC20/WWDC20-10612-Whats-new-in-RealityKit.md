# What's new in RealityKit

RealityKit is Apple‚Äôs rendering, animation, physics, and audio engine built from the ground up for augmented reality: It reimagines the traditional 3D renderer to make it easy for developers to prototype and produce high-quality AR experiences. Learn how to effectively implement each of the latest improvements to RealityKit in your app. Discover features like video textures, scene understanding using the LiDAR scanner on iPad Pro, Location Anchors, face tracking, and improved debugging tools.

To get the most out of this session, you should understand the building blocks of developing RealityKit-based apps and games. Watch ‚ÄúIntroducing RealityKit and Reality Composer‚Äù for a primer.

For more on how you can integrate Reality Composer into your augmented reality workflow, watch "The artist‚Äôs AR toolkit".
