## Automate Siri Queries

- You can automate Siri queries using the scheme editor in Xcode when debugging your extension
- When you're attaching to your intents extension, you have an option to choose between Siri and the Shortcuts.app as the host process

## Debugging intents

- as the intents UI extensions run in a separate processes, your breakpoints won't be hit by default: use the Xcode debug menu to attach to multiple processes at the same time

## "Sorry there was a problem with the app"

If you get this error:

- make sure your intent handler calls the completion handler within 10 seconds
- make sure the completion handler is called once
- your app/extension might have crashed (check crash logs)

## Tips

- use `os_log` and Console.app to see how your app and its extensions interact with each other
