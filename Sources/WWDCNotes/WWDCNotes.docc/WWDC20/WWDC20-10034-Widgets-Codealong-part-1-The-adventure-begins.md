# Widgets Code-along, part 1: The adventure begins

Take your app on a most wondrous adventure to the home and Today screens of iPhone, iPad, and Mac. Grab the starter project and code along with us! We will guide you through the process of creating a widget for your app from start to finish so that you can provide people with beautiful views and glanceable information in an easily-accessible place. Discover how to create a widget project, learn fundamental concepts for widgets and their structure, configure the widget and its provider, and start exploring timeline concepts.

Once youâ€™re finished, travel onward with us to part two of the Widgets Code-along where weâ€™ll learn more about timelines, system intelligence, and configuration.
