# Detect Body and Hand Pose with Vision

Explore how the Vision framework can help your app detect body and hand poses in photos and video. With pose detection, your app can analyze the poses, movements, and gestures of people to offer new video editing possibilities, or to perform action classification when paired with an action classifier built in Create ML. And weâ€™ll show you how you can bring gesture recognition into your app through hand pose, delivering a whole new form of interaction.
