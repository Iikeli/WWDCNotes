# Make your app visually accessible

When you design with accessibility in mind, you empower everyone to use your app. Discover how to create an adaptive interface for your app that takes a thoughtful approach to color, provides readable text, and accommodates other visual settings to maintain a great experience throughout.

We’ve designed this session like our user interfaces —&nbsp;to be accessible to all. If you’d like to learn even more about accessibility and design, you may also enjoy “Visual Design and Accessibility,” “Accessibility Inspector,” “Building Apps with Dynamic Type,” and “Introducing SF Symbols.”
