# Design for intelligence: Meet people where they are

Understand what motivates people to use your app â€” and how you can use system intelligence to help them and achieve your own goals as a developer. We'll take a look at a typical person's journey to better understand how an app can become a key part of their routine â€” and why some apps just don't stick. Learn how you can provide the right kind of value at the right time to help them in their everyday tasks, and how your app and the system can evolve alongside them.
